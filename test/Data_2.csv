Increased sulfation and decreased 7alpha-hydroxylation of deoxycholic acid in ethinyl estradiol-induced cholestasis in rats.;Deoxycholic acid conjugation, transport capacity, and metabolism were compared in control and ethinyl estradiol-treated rats. Control rats were found to have a lower capacity to transport deoxycholic acid than taurodeoxycholic acid, and both were decreased by ethinyl estradiol treatment. During [24-14C]sodium deoxycholate infusion, [14C]biliary bile acid secretion increased, but bile flow did not change significantly in either control or ethinyl estradiol-treated rats. Ethinyl estradiol-treated animals excreted significantly less 14C as taurocholic acid than did control animals, consistent with an impairment of 7alpha-hydroxylation of taurodeoxycholic acid. Ethinyl estradiol treatment did not impair conjugation of deoxycholic acid, but did result in an increase in sulfation of taurodeoxycholic acid from 1.5% in controls to nearly 4.0% (P less than 0.01). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the rat has a poorer tolerance for deoxycholic acid than do certain other species. Furthermore, the rat converts deoxycholic acid, a poor choleretic, to taurocholic acid, a good choleretic. When this conversion is impaired with ethinyl estradiol treatment, sulfation may be an important alternate pathway for excretion of this potentially harmful bile acid.;hepatorenal

Acute effects of N-(2-propylpentanoyl)urea on hippocampal amino acid neurotransmitters in pilocarpine-induced seizure in rats.;The present study aimed to investigate the anticonvulsant activity as well as the effects on the level of hippocampal amino acid neurotransmitters (glutamate, aspartate, glycine and GABA) of N-(2-propylpentanoyl)urea (VPU) in comparison to its parent compound, valproic acid (VPA). VPU was more potent than VPA, exhibiting the median effective dose (ED(50)) of 49 mg/kg in protecting rats against pilocarpine-induced seizure whereas the corresponding value for VPA was 322 mg/kg. In vivo microdialysis demonstrated that an intraperitoneal administration of pilocarpine induced a pronounced increment of hippocampal glutamate and aspartate whereas no significant change was observed on the level of glycine and GABA. Pretreatment with either VPU (50 and 100 mg/kg) or VPA (300 and 600 mg/kg) completely abolished pilocarpine-evoked increases in extracellular glutamate and aspartate. In addition, a statistically significant reduction was also observed on the level of GABA and glycine but less than a drastic reduction of glutamate and aspartate level. Based on the finding that VPU and VPA could protect the animals against pilocarpine-induced seizure it is suggested that the reduction of inhibitory amino acid neurotransmitters was comparatively minor and offset by a pronounced reduction of glutamate and aspartate. Therefore, like VPA, the finding that VPU could drastically reduce pilocarpine-induced increases in glutamate and aspartate should account, at least partly, for its anticonvulsant activity observed in pilocarpine-induced seizure in experimental animals. Some other mechanism than those being reported herein should be further investigated.;neurological
Molecular basis of very long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency in three Israeli patients: identification of a complex mutant allele with P65L and K247Q mutations, the former being an exonic mutation causing exon 3 skipping.;"Very long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase ( VLCAD ) deficiency is a life-threatening disorder of mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation . We identified four novel mutations in three unrelated patients . All patients had the severe childhood form of VLCAD deficiency with early onset and high mortality . Immunoblot analysis revealed that VLCAD protein was undetectable in patients 2 and 3 , whereas normal-size VLCAD protein and an aberrant form of VLCAD ( 4kDa smaller ) were detected in patient 1 . As expected , null mutations were found in patients 2 and 3  patient 2 is homozygous for a frameshift mutation , del 4 bp at 798-801 , and patient 3 is homozygous for a nonsense mutation 65C > A ( S22X ) . Patient 1 was homozygous for a complex mutant allele containing two alterations , including a 194C > T transition ( P65L ) and 739A > C transversion ( K247Q ) ; in the case of P65L , the amino acid change does not reduce enzyme activity . However , the nucleotide change resulted in exon 3 skipping , whereas the latter K247Q mutation had a drastic effect on enzyme activity . We verified these events by in vivo splicing experiments and transient expression analysis of mutant cDNAs . The P65L mutation locates 11 bases upstream of a splice donor site of intron 3 . This is an example of an exonic mutation which affects exon-splicing . .";cardiovascular|hepatorenal

Understanding the molecular basis of fragile X syndrome.;Fragile X syndrome , a common form of inherited mental retardation , is mainly caused by massive expansion of CGG triplet repeats located in the 5-untranslated region of the fragile X mental retardation-1 ( FMR1 ) gene . In patients with fragile X syndrome , the expanded CGG triplet repeats are hypermethylated and the expression of the FMR1 gene is repressed , which leads to the absence of FMR1 protein ( FMRP ) and subsequent mental retardation . FMRP is an RNA-binding protein that shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm . This protein has been implicated in protein translation as it is found associated with polyribosomes and the rough endoplasmic reticulum . We discuss here the recent progress made towards understanding the molecular mechanism of CGG repeat expansion and physiological function ( s ) of FMRP . These studies will not only help to illuminate the molecular basis of the general class of human diseases with trinucleotide repeat expansion but also provide an avenue to understand aspects of human cognition and intelligence . .;neurological

Acetaminophen-induced hypotension.;Through 30 years of widespread use, acetaminophen has been shown to be a remarkably safe medication in therapeutic dosages. The potential for acetaminophen to produce cardiovascular toxicities is very low. However, acetaminophen has been demonstrated to produce symptoms of anaphylaxis, including hypotension, in sensitive individuals. This article describes two critically ill patients in whom transient episodes of hypotension reproducibly developed after administration of acetaminophen. Other symptoms of allergic reactions were not clinically detectable. The hypotensive episodes were severe enough to require vasopressor administration. The reports illustrate the need for clinicians to consider acetaminophen in patients with hypotension of unknown origin.;neurological|cardiovascular

Enhanced bradycardia induced by beta-adrenoceptor antagonists in rats pretreated with isoniazid.;High doses of isoniazid increase hypotension induced by vasodilators and change the accompanying reflex tachycardia to bradycardia, an interaction attributed to decreased synthesis of brain gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). In the present study, the possible enhancement by isoniazid of bradycardia induced by beta-adrenoceptor antagonists was determined in rats anaesthetised with chloralose-urethane. Isoniazid significantly increased bradycardia after propranolol, pindolol, labetalol and atenolol, as well as after clonidine, but not after hexamethonium or carbachol. Enhancement was not observed in rats pretreated with methylatropine or previously vagotomised. These results are compatible with interference by isoniazid with GABAergic inhibition of cardiac parasympathetic tone. Such interference could be exerted centrally, possibly at the nucleus ambiguus, or peripherally at the sinus node.;neurological

Case report: acute unintentional carbachol intoxication.;"INTRODUCTION: Intoxications with carbachol, a muscarinic cholinergic receptor agonist are rare. We report an interesting case investigating a (near) fatal poisoning. METHODS: The son of an 84-year-old male discovered a newspaper report stating clinical success with plant extracts in Alzheimer's disease. The mode of action was said to be comparable to that of the synthetic compound 'carbamylcholin'; that is, carbachol. He bought 25 g of carbachol as pure substance in a pharmacy, and the father was administered 400 to 500 mg. Carbachol concentrations in serum and urine on day 1 and 2 of hospital admission were analysed by HPLC-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Minutes after oral administration, the patient developed nausea, sweating and hypotension, and finally collapsed. Bradycardia, cholinergic symptoms and asystole occurred. Initial cardiopulmonary resuscitation and immediate treatment with adrenaline (epinephrine), atropine and furosemide was successful. On hospital admission, blood pressure of the intubated, bradyarrhythmic patient was 100/65 mmHg. Further signs were hyperhidrosis, hypersalivation, bronchorrhoea, and severe miosis; the electrocardiographic finding was atrio-ventricular dissociation. High doses of atropine (up to 50 mg per 24 hours), adrenaline and dopamine were necessary. The patient was extubated 1 week later. However, increased dyspnoea and bronchospasm necessitated reintubation. Respiratory insufficiency was further worsened by Proteus mirabilis infection and severe bronchoconstriction. One week later, the patient was again extubated and 3 days later was transferred to a peripheral ward. On the next day he died, probably as a result of heart failure. Serum samples from the first and second days contained 3.6 and 1.9 mg/l carbachol, respectively. The corresponding urine concentrations amounted to 374 and 554 mg/l. CONCLUSION: This case started with a media report in a popular newspaper, initiated by published, peer-reviewed research on herbals, and involved human failure in a case history, medical examination and clinical treatment. For the first time, an analytical method for the determination of carbachol in plasma and urine has been developed. The analysed carbachol concentration exceeded the supposed serum level resulting from a therapeutic dose by a factor of 130 to 260. Especially in old patients, intensivists should consider intoxications (with cholinergics) as a cause of acute cardiovascular failure.";neurological|cardiovascular|hepatorenal
Acute interstitial nephritis due to nicergoline (Sermion).;We report a case of acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) due to nicergoline (Sermion). A 50-year-old patient admitted to our hospital for fever and acute renal failure. Before admission, he had been taking nicergoline and bendazac lysine due to retinal vein occlusion at ophthalmologic department. Thereafter, he experienced intermittent fever and skin rash. On admission, clinical symptoms (i.e. arthralgia and fever) and laboratory findings (i.e. eosinophilia and renal failure) suggested AIN, and which was confirmed by pathologic findings on renal biopsy. A lymphocyte transformation test demonstrated a positive result against nicergoline. Treatment was consisted of withdrawal of nicergoline and intravenous methylprednisolone, and his renal function was completely recovered.

Human complement factor H deficiency associated with hemolytic uremic syndrome.;This study reports on six cases of deficiency in the human complement regulatory protein Factor H ( FH ) in the context of an acute renal disease . Five of the cases were observed in children presenting with idiopathic hemolytic uremic syndrome ( HUS ) . Two of the children exhibited a homozygous deficiency characterized by the absence of the 150-kD form of Factor H and the presence , upon immunoblotting , of the 42-kD Factor H-like protein 1 ( FHL-1 ) and other FH-related protein ( FHR ) bands . Southern blot and PCR analysis of DNA of one patient with homozygous deficiency ruled out the presence of a large deletion of the FH gene as the underlying defect for the deficiency . The other four children presented with heterozygous deficiency and exhibited a normal immunoblotting pattern of proteins of the FH family . Factor H deficiency is the only complement deficiency associated with HUS . These observations suggest a role for FH and / or FH receptors in the pathogenesis of idiopathic HUS . .;hepatorenal

Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies in patients with cimetidine-associated mental confusion.;"15 cases of cimetidine-associated mental confusion have been reported. In order that this syndrome might be investigated changes in mental status (M.S.) were correlated with serum concentrations and renal and hepatic function in 36 patients, 30 patients had no M.S. change on cimetidine and 6 had moderate to severe changes. These 6 patients had both renal and liver dysfunction (P less than 0.05), as well as cimetidine trough-concentrations of more than 1.25 microgram/ml (P less than 0.05). The severity of M.S. changes increased as trough-concentrations rose, 5 patients had lumbar puncture. The cerebrospinal fluid: serum ratio of cimetidine concentrations was 0.24:1 and indicates that cimetidine passes the blood-brain barrier; it also raises the possibility that M.S. changes are due to blockade of histamine H2-receptors in the central nervous system. Patients likely to have both raised trough-concentrations and mental confusion are those with both severe renal and hepatic dysfunction. They should be closely observed and should be given reduced doses of cimetidine.";neurological|hepatorenal

Severe complications of antianginal drug therapy in a patient identified as a poor metabolizer of metoprolol, propafenone, diltiazem, and sparteine.;A 47-year-old patient suffering from coronary artery disease was admitted to the CCU in shock with III. AV block, severe hypotension, and impairment of ventricular function. One week prior to admission a therapy with standard doses of metoprolol (100 mg t.i.d. and then 100 mg b.i.d.) had been initiated. Two days before admission diltiazem (60 mg b.i.d.) was prescribed in addition. Analyses of a blood sample revealed unusually high plasma concentrations of metoprolol (greater than 3000 ng/ml) and diltiazem (526 ng/ml). The patient recovered within 1 week following discontinuation of antianginal therapy. Three months later the patient was exposed to a single dose of metoprolol, diltiazem, propafenone (since he had received this drug in the past), and sparteine (as a probe for the debrisoquine/sparteine type polymorphism of oxidative drug metabolism). It was found that he was a poor metabolizer of all four drugs, indicating that their metabolism is under the same genetic control. Therefore, patients belonging to the poor-metabolizer phenotype of sparteine/debrisoquine polymorphism in drug metabolism, which constitutes 6.4% of the German population, may experience adverse drug reactions when treated with standard doses of one of these drugs alone. Moreover, the coadministration of these frequently used drugs is expected to be especially harmful in this subgroup of patients.;cardiovascular

Protection against amphetamine-induced neurotoxicity toward striatal dopamine neurons in rodents by LY274614, an excitatory amino acid antagonist.;"LY274614, 3SR,4aRS,6SR,8aRS-6-[phosphonomethyl]decahydr oisoquinoline-3- carboxylic acid, has been described as a potent antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of glutamate receptor. Here its ability to antagonize the prolonged depletion of dopamine in the striatum by amphetamine in iprindole-treated rats is reported. A single 18.4 mg/kg (i.p.) dose of (+/-)-amphetamine hemisulfate, given to rats pretreated with iprindole, resulted in persistent depletion of dopamine in the striatum 1 week later. This prolonged depletion of dopamine in the striatum was antagonized by dizocilpine (MK-801, a non-competitive antagonist of NMDA receptors) or by LY274614 (a competitive antagonist of NMDA receptors). The protective effect of LY274614 was dose-dependent, being maximum at 10-40 mgkg (i.p.). A 10 mg/kg dose of LY274614 was effective in antagonizing the depletion of dopamine in the striatum, when given as long as 8 hr prior to amphetamine but not when given 24 hr prior to amphetamine. Depletion of dopamine in the striatum was also antagonized when LY274614 was given after the injection of amphetamine; LY274614 protected when given up to 4 hr after but not when given 8 or 24 hr after amphetamine. The prolonged depletion of dopamine in the striatum in mice, given multiple injections of methamphetamine, was also antagonized dose-dependently and completely by LY274614. The data strengthen the evidence that the neurotoxic effect of amphetamine and related compounds toward nigrostriatal dopamine neurons involves NMDA receptors and that LY274614 is an NMDA receptor antagonist with long-lasting in vivo effects in rats.";neurological

Rhabdomyolysis in a hepatitis C virus infected patient treated with telaprevir and simvastatin.;A 46-year old man with a chronic hepatitis C virus infection received triple therapy with ribavirin, pegylated interferon and telaprevir. The patient also received simvastatin. One month after starting the antiviral therapy, the patient was admitted to the hospital because he developed rhabdomyolysis. At admission simvastatin and all antiviral drugs were discontinued because toxicity due to a drug-drug interaction was suspected. The creatine kinase peaked at 62,246 IU/L and the patient was treated with intravenous normal saline. The patient's renal function remained unaffected. Fourteen days after hospitalization, creatine kinase level had returned to 230 IU/L and the patient was discharged. Telaprevir was considered the probable causative agent of an interaction with simvastatin according to the Drug Interaction Probability Scale. The interaction is due to inhibition of CYP3A4-mediated simvastatin clearance. Simvastatin plasma concentration increased 30 times in this patient and statin induced muscle toxicity is related to the concentration of the statin in blood. In conclusion, with this case we illustrate that telaprevir as well as statins are susceptible to clinical relevant drug-drug interactions.;hepatorenal

Carboplatin toxic effects on the peripheral nervous system of the rat.;BACKGROUND: The most striking of carboplatin's advantages (CBDCA) over cisplatin (CDDP) is its markedly reduced rate of neurotoxic effects. However, the use of CBDCA higher-intensity schedules and the association with other neurotoxic drugs in polychemotherapy may cause some concern about its safety with respect to peripheral nervous system damage. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two different schedules of CBDCA administration (10 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg i.p. twice a week for nine times) were evaluated in Wistar rats. Neurotoxicity was assessed for behavioral (tail-flick test), neurophysiological (nerve conduction velocity in the tail nerve), morphological, morphometrical and analytical effects. RESULTS: CBDCA administration induced dose-dependent peripheral neurotoxicity. Pain perception and nerve conduction velocity in the tail were significantly impaired, particularly after the high-dose treatment. The dorsal root ganglia sensory neurons and, to a lesser extent, satellite cells showed the same changes as those induced by CDDP, mainly affecting the nucleus and nucleolus of ganglionic sensory neurons. Moreover, significant amounts of platinum were detected in the dorsal root ganglia and kidney after CBDCA treatment. CONCLUSIONS: CBDCA is neurotoxic in our model, and the type of pathological changes it induces are so closely similar to those caused by CDDP that it is probable that neurotoxicity is induced in the two drugs by the same mechanism. This model can be used alone or in combination with other drugs to explore the effect of CBDCA on the peripheral nervous system.;neurological|hepatorenal

Aberrant splicing of phenylalanine hydroxylase mRNA: the major cause for phenylketonuria in parts of southern Europe.;We report a mutation within the phenylalanine hydroxylase ( PAH ) gene that causes aberrant splicing of the mRNA and that is in tight association with chromosomal haplotypes 6 , 10 , and 36 . Because of the high frequency of these particular haplotypes in Bulgaria , Italy , and Turkey , it appears to be one of the more frequent defects in the PAH gene causing classical phenylketonuria in this part of Europe . The mutation is a G to A transition at position 546 in intron 10 of the PAH gene , 11 bp upstream from the intron 10 / exon 11 boundary . It activates a cryptic splice site and results in an in-frame insertion of 9 nucleotides between exon 10 and exon 11 of the processed mRNA . Normal amounts of liver PAH protein are present in homozygous patients , but no catalytic activity can be detected . This loss of enzyme activity is probably caused by conformational changes resulting from the insertion of three additional amino acids ( Gly-Leu-Gln ) between the normal sequences encoded by exon 10 and exon 11 . .;hepatorenal

Survey of complications of indocyanine green angiography in Japan.;PURPOSE: We evaluated the safety of indocyanine green for use in fundus angiography. METHODS: We sent a questionnaire concerning complications of indocyanine green to 32 institutions in Japan, which were selected on the basis of the client list from the Topcon Company, which manufactures the indocyanine green fundus camera. RESULTS: Ophthalmologists at 15 institutions responded, reporting a total of 3,774 indocyanine green angiograms performed on 2,820 patients between June 1984 and September 1992. Before angiography, intradermal or intravenous indocyanine green testing, or both was performed at 13 of 15 institutions. For three patients, the decision was made not to proceed with angiography after positive preangiographic testing. The dosage of indocyanine green used for angiography varied from 25 to 75 mg, depending upon the institution. There were 13 cases of adverse reactions (0.34%), ten of which were mild reactions such as nausea, exanthema, urtication, itchiness, and urgency to defecate, and did not require treatment. Also recorded were one case of pain of the vein, which required treatment, and two cases of hypotension. The two hypotensive patients required treatment for shock. CONCLUSIONS: A comparison of frequency of adverse reactions to indocyanine green with the previously reported frequency of such reactions to fluorescein sodium indicated that indocyanine green is a safe as fluorescein for use in angiography.;neurological
Upregulation of brain expression of P-glycoprotein in MRP2-deficient TR(-) rats resembles seizure-induced up-regulation of this drug efflux transporter in normal rats.;PURPOSE: The multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2) is a drug efflux transporter that is expressed predominantly at the apical domain of hepatocytes but seems also to be expressed at the apical membrane of brain capillary endothelial cells that form the blood-brain barrier (BBB). MRP2 is absent in the transport-deficient (TR(-)) Wistar rat mutant, so that this rat strain was very helpful in defining substrates of MRP2 by comparing tissue concentrations or functional activities of compounds in MRP2-deficient rats with those in transport-competent Wistar rats. By using this strategy to study the involvement of MRP2 in brain access of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), we recently reported that phenytoin is a substrate for MRP2 in the BBB. However, one drawback of such studies in genetically deficient rats is the fact that compensatory changes with upregulation of other transporters can occur. This prompted us to study the brain expression of P-glycoprotein (Pgp), a major drug efflux transporter in many tissues, including the BBB, in TR(-) rats compared with nonmutant (wild-type) Wistar rats. METHODS: The expression of MRP2 and Pgp in brain and liver sections of TR(-) rats and normal Wistar rats was determined with immunohistochemistry, by using a novel, highly selective monoclonal MRP2 antibody and the monoclonal Pgp antibody C219, respectively. RESULTS: Immunofluorescence staining with the MRP2 antibody was found to label a high number of microvessels throughout the brain in normal Wistar rats, whereas such labeling was absent in TR(-) rats. TR(-) rats exhibited a significant up-regulation of Pgp in brain capillary endothelial cells compared with wild-type controls. No such obvious upregulation of Pgp was observed in liver sections. A comparable overexpression of Pgp in the BBB was obtained after pilocarpine-induced seizures in wild-type Wistar rats. Experiments with systemic administration of the Pgp substrate phenobarbital and the selective Pgp inhibitor tariquidar in TR(-) rats substantiated that Pgp is functional and compensates for the lack of MRP2 in the BBB. CONCLUSIONS: The data on TR(-) rats indicate that Pgp plays an important role in the compensation of MRP2 deficiency in the BBB. Because such a compensatory mechanism most likely occurs to reduce injury to the brain from cytotoxic compounds, the present data substantiate the concept that MRP2 performs a protective role in the BBB. Furthermore, our data suggest that TR(-) rats are an interesting tool to study consequences of overexpression of Pgp in the BBB on access of drugs in the brain, without the need of inducing seizures or other Pgp-enhancing events for this purpose.;neurological|hepatorenal

Uni- and multivariate analyses were used to test the influence of the clinical variables: age, sex, stroke, myocardiopathy (MP), duration of the test, mitral regurgitation (MR) and the MZ dose. RESULTS: All patients (65+/-16 yrs; 58% males) finished the examination. The mean doses of MZ and FL were 4.3+/-1.9 mg and 0.28+/-0.2 mg, respectively. The duration of the examination and the mean ejection fraction (EF) were 16.4+/-6.1 minutes and 60+/-9%, respectively. Mild hypoxia (SO2<90%) was the most common event (11 patients); 3 patients (2%) presented transient hypoxia due to upper airway obstruction by probe introduction and 8 (5.8%) due to hypoxia caused by MZ use. Transient hypotension (SAP<90mmHg) occurred in 1 patient (0.7%). The multivariate analysis showed that severe MR, MP (EF<45%) and high doses of MZ (>5mg) were associated with events (p<0.001). The EF was 40%, in the group with MP and 44% in the group with severe MR and it can be a factor associated with clinical events in the last group. CONCLUSION: TEE with sedation presents a low rate of events. There were no severe events and there was no need to interrupt the examinations.";cardiovascular
Acute renal failure in patients with AIDS on tenofovir while receiving prolonged vancomycin course for osteomyelitis.;Renal failure developed after a prolonged course of vancomycin therapy in 2 patients who were receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate as part of an antiretroviral regimen. Tenofovir has been implicated in the development of Fanconi syndrome and renal insufficiency because of its effects on the proximal renal tubule. Vancomycin nephrotoxicity is infrequent but may result from coadministration with a nephrotoxic agent. Clinicians should be aware that tenofovir may raise the risk of renal failure during prolonged administration of vancomycin.;hepatorenal
Founder BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in French Canadian breast and ovarian cancer families.;We have identified four mutations in each of the breast cancer-susceptibility genes , BRCA1 and BRCA2 , in French Canadian breast cancer and breast / ovarian cancer families from Quebec .

Coenzyme Q10 treatment ameliorates acute cisplatin nephrotoxicity in mice.;The nephroprotective effect of coenzyme Q10 was investigated in mice with acute renal injury induced by a single i.p. injection of cisplatin (5 mg/kg). Coenzyme Q10 treatment (10 mg/kg/day, i.p.) was applied for 6 consecutive days, starting 1 day before cisplatin administration. Coenzyme Q10 significantly reduced blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels which were increased by cisplatin. Coenzyme Q10 significantly compensated deficits in the antioxidant defense mechanisms (reduced glutathione level and superoxide dismutase activity), suppressed lipid peroxidation, decreased the elevations of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, nitric oxide and platinum ion concentration, and attenuated the reductions of selenium and zinc ions in renal tissue resulted from cisplatin administration. Also, histopathological renal tissue damage mediated by cisplatin was ameliorated by coenzyme Q10 treatment. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that coenzyme Q10 significantly decreased the cisplatin-induced overexpression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, nuclear factor-kappaB, caspase-3 and p53 in renal tissue. It was concluded that coenzyme Q10 represents a potential therapeutic option to protect against acute cisplatin nephrotoxicity commonly encountered in clinical practice.;neurological|hepatorenal|oncological

Reverse or inverted left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome (reverse Takotsubo cardiomyopathy) in a young woman in the setting of amphetamine use.;"Transient left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome was first described in Japan as ""Takotsubo cardiomyopathy."" This syndrome has been identified in many other countries. Many variations of this syndrome have been recently described in the literature. One of the rarest is the reverse type of this syndrome, with hyperdynamic apex and complete akinesia of the base (as opposed to the classic apical ballooning). In this article, we report an interesting case of a young woman who presented with this rare type of reverse apical ballooning syndrome occurring after amphetamine use. This report is followed by review of the literature.";cardiovascular
Detailed spectral profile analysis of penicillin-induced epileptiform activity in anesthetized rats.;Penicillin model is a widely used experimental model for epilepsy research. In the present study we aimed to portray a detailed spectral analysis of penicillin-induced epileptiform activity in comparison with basal brain activity in anesthetized Wistar rats. Male Wistar rats were anesthetized with i.p. urethane and connected to an electrocorticogram setup. After a short period of basal activity recording, epileptic focus was induced by injecting 400IU/2 microl penicillin-G potassium into the left lateral ventricle while the cortical activity was continuously recorded. Basal activity, latent period and the penicillin-induced epileptiform activity periods were then analyzed using both conventional methods and spectral analysis. Spectral analyses were conducted by dividing the whole spectrum into different frequency bands including delta, theta (slow and fast), alpha-sigma, beta (1 and 2) and gamma (1 and 2) bands. Our results show that the most affected frequency bands were delta, theta, beta-2 and gamma-2 bands during the epileptiform activity and there were marked differences in terms of spectral densities between three investigated episodes (basal activity, latent period and epileptiform activity). Our results may help to analyze novel data obtained using similar experimental models and the simple analysis method described here can be used in similar studies to investigate the basic neuronal mechanism of this or other types of experimental epilepsies.;neurological|cardiovascular
Resuscitation with lipid, epinephrine, or both in levobupivacaine-induced cardiac toxicity in newborn piglets.;BACKGROUND: The optimal dosing regimens of lipid emulsion, epinephrine, or both are not yet determined in neonates in cases of local anaesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST). METHODS: Newborn piglets received levobupivacaine until cardiovascular collapse occurred. Standard cardiopulmonary resuscitation was started and electrocardiogram (ECG) was monitored for ventricular tachycardia, fibrillation, or QRS prolongation. Piglets were then randomly allocated to four groups: control (saline), Intralipid( ) alone, epinephrine alone, or a combination of Intralipd plus epinephrine. Resuscitation continued for 30 min or until there was a return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) accompanied by a mean arterial pressure at or superior to the baseline pressure and normal sinus rhythm for a period of 30 min. RESULTS: ROSC was achieved in only one of the control piglets compared with most of the treated piglets. Mortality was not significantly different between the three treatment groups, but was significantly lower in all the treatment groups compared with control. The number of ECG abnormalities was zero in the Intralipid only group, but 14 and 17, respectively, in the epinephrine and epinephrine plus lipid groups (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Lipid emulsion with or without epinephrine, or epinephrine alone were equally effective in achieving a return to spontaneous circulation in this model of LAST. Epinephrine alone or in combination with lipid was associated with an increased number of ECG abnormalities compared with lipid emulsion alone.;cardiovascular
Characterization of estrogen-induced adenohypophyseal tumors in the Fischer 344 rat.;Pituitary tumors were induced in F344 female rats by chronic treatment with diethylstilbestrol (DES, 8-10 mg) implanted subcutaneously in silastic capsules. Over a range of 1-150 days of DES treatment, pairs of control and DES-treated rats were sacrificed, and their pituitaries dissociated enzymatically into single-cell preparations. The cell populations were examined regarding total cell recovery correlated with gland weight, intracellular prolactin (PRL) content and subsequent release in primary culture, immunocytochemical PRL staining, density and/or size alterations via separation on Ficoll-Hypaque and by unit gravity sedimentation, and cell cycle analysis, after acriflavine DNA staining, by laser flow cytometry. Total cell yields from DES-treated pituitaries increased from 1.3 times control yields at 8 days of treatment to 58.9 times control values by day 150. Intracellular PRL content ranged from 1.9 to 9.4 times control levels, and PRL release in vitro was significantly and consistently higher than controls, after at least 8 days of DES exposure. Beyond 8 days of DES exposure, the immunochemically PRL-positive proportion of cells increased to over 50% of the total population. Increased density and/or size and PRL content were indicated for the majority of the PRL cell population in both types of separation protocols. All these effects of DES were more pronounced among previously ovariectomized animals. The data extend the findings of other investigators, further establishing the DES-induced tumor as a model for study of PRL cellular control mechanisms.;neurological|oncological
Organophosphate-induced convulsions and prevention of neuropathological damages.;Such organophosphorus (OP) compounds as diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP), sarin and soman are potent inhibitors of acetylcholinesterases (AChEs) and butyrylcholinesterases (BChEs). The acute toxicity of OPs is the result of their irreversible binding with AChEs in the central nervous system (CNS), which elevates acetylcholine (ACh) levels. The protective action of subcutaneously (SC) administered antidotes or their combinations in DFP (2.0 mg/kg BW) intoxication was studied in 9-10-weeks-old Han-Wistar male rats. The rats received AChE reactivator pralidoxime-2-chloride (2PAM) (30.0 mg/kg BW), anticonvulsant diazepam (2.0 mg/kg BW), A(1)-adenosine receptor agonist N(6)-cyclopentyl adenosine (CPA) (2.0 mg/kg BW), NMDA-receptor antagonist dizocilpine maleate (+-MK801 hydrogen maleate) (2.0 mg/kg BW) or their combinations with cholinolytic drug atropine sulfate (50.0 mg/kg BW) immediately or 30 min after the single SC injection of DFP. The control rats received atropine sulfate, but also saline and olive oil instead of other antidotes and DFP, respectively. All rats were terminated either 24 h or 3 weeks after the DFP injection. The rats treated with DFP-atropine showed severe typical OP-induced toxicity signs. When CPA, diazepam or 2PAM was given immediately after DFP-atropine, these treatments prevented, delayed or shortened the occurrence of serious signs of poisoning. Atropine-MK801 did not offer any additional protection against DFP toxicity. In conclusion, CPA, diazepam and 2PAM in combination with atropine prevented the occurrence of serious signs of poisoning and thus reduced the toxicity of DFP in rat.;neurological

Design and analysis of the HYPREN-trial: safety of enalapril and prazosin in the initial treatment phase of patients with congestive heart failure.;Since the introduction of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors into the adjunctive treatment of patients with congestive heart failure, cases of severe hypotension, especially on the first day of treatment, have occasionally been reported. To assess the safety of the ACE inhibitor enalapril a multicenter, randomized, prazosin-controlled trial was designed that compared the incidence and severity of symptomatic hypotension on the first day of treatment. Trial medication was 2.5 mg enalapril or 0.5 prazosin. Subjects were 1210 inpatients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II and III. Patients who received enalapril experienced clinically and statistically significantly less symptomatic hypotension (5.2%) than the patients who received prazosin (12.9%). All patients recovered. It was concluded that treatment with enalapril was well tolerated and it is, therefore, unreasonable to restrict the initiation of treatment with enalapril to inpatients.;cardiovascular

Thrombotic microangiopathy and renal failure associated with antineoplastic chemotherapy.;Five patients with carcinoma developed thrombotic microangiopathy (characterized by renal insufficiency, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and usually thrombocytopenia) after treatment with cisplatin, bleomycin, and a vinca alkaloid. One patient had thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, three the hemolytic-uremic syndrome, and one an apparent forme fruste of one of these disorders. Histologic examination of the renal tissue showed evidence of intravascular coagulation, primarily affecting the small arteries, arterioles, and glomeruli. Because each patient was tumor-free or had only a small tumor at the onset of this syndrome, the thrombotic microangiopathy may have been induced by chemotherapy. Diagnosis of this potentially fatal complication may be delayed or missed if renal tissue or the peripheral blood smear is not examined, because renal failure may be ascribed to cisplatin nephrotoxicity and the anemia and thrombocytopenia to drug-induced bone marrow suppression.;hepatorenal|oncological

The type of somatic mutation at APC in familial adenomatous polyposis is determined by the site of the germline mutation: a new facet to Knudson's 'two-hit' hypothesis.;APC is often cited as a prime example of a tumor suppressor gene . Truncating germline and somatic mutations ( or , infrequently , allelic loss ) occur in tumors in FAP ( familial adenomatous polyposis ) . Most sporadic colorectal cancers also have two APC mutations . Clues from attenuated polyposis , missense germline variants with mild disease and the somatic mutation cluster region ( codons 1 , 250-1 , 450 ) indicate , however , that APC mutations might not result in simple loss of protein function . We have found that FAP patients with germline APC mutations within a small region ( codons 1 , 194-1 , 392 at most ) mainly show allelic loss in their colorectal adenomas , in contrast to other FAP patients , whose second hits tend to occur by truncating mutations in the mutation cluster region . Our results indicate that different APC mutations provide cells with different selective advantages , with mutations close to codon 1 , 300 providing the greatest advantage . Allelic loss is selected strongly in cells with one mutation near codon 1 , 300 . A different germline-somatic APC mutation association exists in FAP desmoids . APC is not , therefore , a classical tumor suppressor . Our findings also indicate a new mechanism for disease severity  if a broader spectrum of mutations is selected in tumors , the somatic mutation rate is effectively higher and more tumors grow . .;oncological

Differential diagnosis of high serum creatine kinase levels in systemic lupus erythematosus.;We report the clinical and bioptic findings for a 57-year-old woman with severe chloroquine-induced myopathy. Since 1989, she had been suffering from systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with renal involvement and undergone periods of treatment with azathioprine and cyclophosphamide. Additional therapy with chloroquine (CQ) was started because of arthralgia. At the same time, slightly increased creatine kinase (CK) levels were noted. Myositis was suspected, and the patient was treated with steroids. The CK increase persisted, however, and she developed progressive muscular weakness and muscular atrophy. Routine controls revealed markedly elevated CK levels of 1,700 U/l. The neurological and electrophysiological findings were not typical of myositis. Thus, muscle biopsy of the deltoid muscle was performed in order to exclude polymyositis or toxic myopathy. As it revealed chloroquine-induced myopathy, medication was stopped. Discriminating between primary SLE-induced affection of the musculoskeletal system and drug-induced side effects is important for appropriate treatment of SLE patients.;neurological|hepatorenal

Myotonia levior is a chloride channel disorder.;The group of dominant non-dystrophic myotonias , comprising disorders characterized by clinically similar forms of myogenic muscle stiffness , is genetically inhomogeneous . Dominant myotonia congenita ( Thomsens disease ) is linked to CLCN1 , the gene encoding the major muscle chloride channel , localized on chromosome 7q35 . In contrast , dominant myotonias sensitive to potassium are caused by point mutations in SCN4A on chromosome 17q , the gene for the alpha subunit of the adult skeletal muscle sodium channel . No linkage or molecular genetic data are as yet available on myotonia levior characterized by milder symptoms and later onset of myotonia than in Thomsens disease , and absence of muscle hypertrophy . We report a CLCN1 Gln-552-Arg substitution for a family with dominant inheritance previously diagnosed to have myotonia levior . Thus , this disorder appears as a variant of Thomsens disease due to mutations leading to low clinical expressivity . In addition , we report a novel Ile-290-Met CLCN1 mutation for a typical Thomsen pedigree .

Norepinephrine signaling through beta-adrenergic receptors is critical for expression of cocaine-induced anxiety.;BACKGROUND: Cocaine is a widely abused psychostimulant that has both rewarding and aversive properties. While the mechanisms underlying cocaine's rewarding effects have been studied extensively, less attention has been paid to the unpleasant behavioral states induced by cocaine, such as anxiety. METHODS: In this study, we evaluated the performance of dopamine beta-hydroxylase knockout (Dbh -/-) mice, which lack norepinephrine (NE), in the elevated plus maze (EPM) to examine the contribution of noradrenergic signaling to cocaine-induced anxiety. RESULTS: We found that cocaine dose-dependently increased anxiety-like behavior in control (Dbh +/-) mice, as measured by a decrease in open arm exploration. The Dbh -/- mice had normal baseline performance in the EPM but were completely resistant to the anxiogenic effects of cocaine. Cocaine-induced anxiety was also attenuated in Dbh +/- mice following administration of disulfiram, a dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) inhibitor. In experiments using specific adrenergic antagonists, we found that pretreatment with the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol blocked cocaine-induced anxiety-like behavior in Dbh +/- and wild-type C57BL6/J mice, while the alpha(1) antagonist prazosin and the alpha(2) antagonist yohimbine had no effect. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that noradrenergic signaling via beta-adrenergic receptors is required for cocaine-induced anxiety in mice.;neurological
Genetic defect in secretion of complement C5 in mice.;A genetic deficiency of the fifth ( C5 ) component of complement1-3 , a serum glycoprotein of molecular weight ( MW ) 220 , 000 ( ref . 4 ) , has been found in 39 % of inbred strains of mice3 . Sera of deficient mice lack detectable C5 activity and protein2 , 3 . In addition deficient mice produce antibody to mouse C5 when injected with sera from C5 sufficient ( normal ) strains . Levy et al . 5 showed that somatic cell hybrids between C5 deficient ( B10 . D2 / old line ) macrophages and either C5 sufficient ( B10 . D2 / new line ) mouse kidney or chicken erythroblasts secreted haemolytically active mouse C5 in vitro . Several possible molecular mechanisms to account for the findings were considered , but insufficient direct data were available to choose among them . We recently reported that mouse ( CD . 1 strain ) peritoneal cells in culture synthesise and secrete a single chain precursor , pro-C5 ( MW approximately 210 , 000 ) , of the two-chain ( alpha chain , 125 , 000 and beta chain 83 , 000 MW ) C5 protein6 . Radiolabelled precursor C5 was contained within the cells and was secreted into the tissue culture media . Using similar methods , we now find that C5 deficiency in each of five different mouse strains ( AKR , SWR , DBA / 2J8 A / HeJ and B10 . D2 / old line ) is due to a failure in secretion of C5 protein and not to a failure in biosynthesis of pro-C5;neurological|hepatorenal

Flestolol: an ultra-short-acting beta-adrenergic blocking agent.;Flestolol (ACC-9089) is a nonselective, competitive, ultra-short-acting beta-adrenergic blocking agent, without any intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Flestolol is metabolized by plasma esterases and has an elimination half-life of approximately 6.5 minutes. This agent was well tolerated in healthy volunteers at doses up to 100 micrograms/kg/min. In long-term infusion studies, flestolol was well tolerated at the effective beta-blocking dose (5 micrograms/kg/min) for up to seven days. Flestolol blood concentrations increased linearly with increasing dose and good correlation exists between blood concentrations of flestolol and beta-adrenergic blockade. Flestolol produced a dose-dependent attenuation of isoproterenol-induced tachycardia. Electrophysiologic and hemodynamic effects of flestolol are similar to those of other beta blockers. In contrast with other beta blockers, flestolol-induced effects reverse rapidly (within 30 minutes) following discontinuation because of its short half-life. Flestolol effectively reduced heart rate in patients with supraventricular tachyarrhythmia. In patients with unstable angina, flestolol infusion was found to be safe and effective in controlling chest pain.

Bilateral haemorrhagic infarction of the globus pallidus after cocaine and alcohol intoxication.;Cocaine is a risk factor for both ischemic and haemorrhagic stroke. We present the case of a 31-year-old man with bilateral ischemia of the globus pallidus after excessive alcohol and intranasal cocaine use. Drug-related globus pallidus infarctions are most often associated with heroin. Bilateral basal ganglia infarcts after the use of cocaine, without concurrent heroin use, have never been reported. In our patient, transient cardiac arrhythmia or respiratory dysfunction related to cocaine and/or ethanol use were the most likely causes of cerebral hypoperfusion.;cardiovascular

Role of xanthine oxidase in dexamethasone-induced hypertension in rats.;"1. Glucocorticoid-induced hypertension (GC-HT) in the rat is associated with nitric oxide-redox imbalance. 2. We studied the role of xanthine oxidase (XO), which is implicated in the production of reactive oxygen species, in dexamethasone-induced hypertension (dex-HT). 3. Thirty male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided randomly into four treatment groups: saline, dexamethasone (dex), allopurinol plus saline, and allopurinol plus dex. 4. Systolic blood pressures (SBP) and bodyweights were recorded each alternate day. Thymus weight was used as a marker of glucocorticoid activity, and serum urate to assess XO inhibition. 5. Dex increased SBP (110 +/- 2-126 +/- 3 mmHg; P < 0.001) and decreased thymus (P < 0.001) and bodyweights (P"" < 0.01). Allopurinol decreased serum urate from 76 +/- 5 to 30 +/- 3 micromol/L (P < 0.001) in saline and from 84 +/- 13 to 28 +/- 2 micromol/L in dex-treated (P < 0.01) groups. 6. Allopurinol did not prevent dex-HT. This, together with our previous findings that allopurinol failed to prevent adrenocorticotrophic hormone induced hypertension, suggests that XO activity is not a major determinant of GC-HT in the rat.";cardiovascular
Changes in depressive status associated with topical beta-blockers.;Depression and sexual dysfunction have been related to side effects of topical beta-blockers. We performed a preliminary study in order to determine any difference between a non selective beta-blocker (timolol) and a selective beta-blocker (betaxolol) regarding CNS side effects. Eight glaucomatous patients chronically treated with timolol 0.5%/12h, suffering from depression diagnosed through DMS-III-R criteria, were included in the study. During the six-month follow up, depression was quantified through the Beck and Zung-Conde scales every two months. In a double blind cross-over study with control group, the patients under timolol treatment presented higher depression values measured through the Beck and the Zung-Conde scales (p < 0.001 vs control). These results suggest that betaxolol could be less of a depression-inducer than timolol in predisposed patients.;neurological

Prophylactic use of lamivudine with chronic immunosuppressive therapy for rheumatologic disorders.;The objective of this study was to report our experience concerning the effectiveness of the prophylactic administration of lamivudine in hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBs Ag) positive patients with rheumatologic disease. From June 2004 to October 2006, 11 HBs Ag positive patients with rheumatologic diseases, who were on both immunosuppressive and prophylactic lamivudine therapies, were retrospectively assessed. Liver function tests, hepatitis B virus (HBV) serologic markers, and HBV DNA levels of the patients during follow-up were obtained from hospital file records. Eleven patients (six male) with median age 47 years (range 27-73), median disease duration 50 months (range 9-178) and median follow-up period of patients 13.8 months (range 5-27) were enrolled in this study. Lamivudine therapy was started 3-7 days prior to immunosuppressive therapy in all patients. Baseline, liver function tests were elevated in two patients (fourth patient: ALT:122 IU/l, AST:111 IU/l, tenth patient:ALT:294 IU/l, AST:274 IU/l, with minimal changes in the liver biopsy in both). Shortly after treatment their tests normalized and during follow-up period none of the patients had abnormal liver function tests. In four patients HBV DNA levels were higher than normal at baseline. Two of these normalized and the others increased later. In three additional patients, HBV DNA levels were increased during follow-up. None of the patients had significant clinical sings of HBV activation. Lamivudine was well tolerated and was continued in all patients. Prophylactic administration of lamivudine in patients who required immunosuppressive therapy seems to be safe, well tolerated and effective in preventing HBV reactivation.;neurological|hepatorenal
Clinical and molecular genetic analysis of 19 Wolfram syndrome kindreds demonstrating a wide spectrum of mutations in WFS1.;Wolfram syndrome is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by juvenile-onset diabetes mellitus and progressive optic atrophy . mtDNA deletions have been described , and a gene ( WFS1 ) recently has been identified , on chromosome 4p16 , encoding a predicted 890 amino acid transmembrane protein . Direct DNA sequencing was done to screen the entire coding region of the WFS1 gene in 30 patients from 19 British kindreds with Wolfram syndrome . DNA was also screened for structural rearrangements ( deletions and duplications ) and point mutations in mtDNA . No pathogenic mtDNA mutations were found in our cohort . We identified 24 mutations in the WFS1 gene  8 nonsense mutations , 8 missense mutations , 3 in-frame deletions , 1 in-frame insertion , and 4 frameshift mutations . Of these , 23 were novel mutations , and most occurred in exon 8 . The majority of patients were compound heterozygotes for two mutations , and there was no common founder mutation . The data were also analyzed for genotype-phenotype relationships . Although some interesting cases were noted , consideration of the small sample size and frequency of each mutation indicated no clear-cut correlations between any of the observed mutations and disease severity . There were no obvious mutation hot spots or clusters . Hence , molecular screening for Wolfram syndrome in affected families and for Wolfram syndrome-carrier status in subjects with psychiatric disorders or diabetes mellitus will require complete analysis of exon 8 and upstream exons . .;neurological

Suxamethonium-induced cardiac arrest and death following 5 days of immobilization.;The present report describes a case of cardiac arrest and subsequent death as a result of hyperkalaemia following the use of suxamethonium in a 23-year-old Malawian woman. Five days after the onset of the symptoms of meningitis, the patient aspirated stomach contents and needed endotracheal intubation. Forty seconds after injection of suxamethonium, bradycardia and cardiac arrest occurred. Attempts to resuscitate the patient were not successful. The serum level of potassium was observed to be 8.4 mequiv L-1. Apart from the reduction in the patient's level of consciousness, there were no signs of motor neurone damage or of any of the other known predisposing conditions for hyperkalaemia following the administration of suxamethonium. It is postulated that her death was caused by hypersensitivity to suxamethonium, associated with her 5-day immobilization.;neurological
The epidemiology of the acute flank pain syndrome from suprofen.;"Suprofen, a new nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, was marketed in early 1986 as an analgesic agent. Until physicians began reporting an unusual acute flank pain syndrome to the spontaneous reporting system, 700,000 persons used the drug in the United States. Through August 1986, a total of 163 cases of this syndrome were reported. To elucidate the epidemiology of the syndrome, a case-control study was performed, comparing 62 of the case patients who had been reported to the spontaneous reporting system to 185 suprofen-exposed control subjects who did not have the syndrome. Case patients were more likely to be men (odds ratio, 3.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-12.1), suffer from hay fever and asthma (odds ratio, 3.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-11.9); to participate in regular exercise (odds ratio, 5.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-30.7), especially in the use of Nautilus equipment (p = 0.02); and to use alcohol (odds ratio, 4.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-17.5). Possible risk factors included young age, concurrent use of other analgesic agents (especially ibuprofen), preexisting renal disease, a history of kidney stones, a history of gout, a recent increase in activity, a recent increase in sun exposure, and residence in the Sunbelt. These were findings that were suggestive but did not reach conventional statistical significance. These findings are consistent with the postulated mechanism for this unusual syndrome: acute diffuse crystallization of uric acid in renal tubules.";hepatorenal

The BRCA1 coding region was examined for mutations in primary breast and ovarian tumors that show allele loss at the BRCA1 locus . Mutations were detected in 3 of 32 breast and 1 of 12 ovarian carcinomas ; all four mutations were germline alterations and occurred in early-onset cancers . These results suggest that mutation of BRCA1 may not be critical in the development of the majority of breast and ovarian cancers that arise in the absence of a mutant germline allele . .";oncological

On the mechanisms of the development of tolerance to the muscular rigidity produced by morphine in rats.;The development of tolerance to the muscular rigidity produced by morphine was studied in rats. Saline-pretreated controls given a test dose of morphine (20 mg/kg i.p.) showed a pronounced rigidity recorded as tonic activity in the electromyogram. Rats treated for 11 days with morphine and withdrawn for 36-40 h showed differences in the development of tolerance: about half of the animals showed a rigidity after the test dose of morphine that was not significantly less than in the controls and were akinetic (A group). The other rats showed a strong decrease in the rigidity and the occurrence of stereotyped (S) licking and/or gnawing in presence of akinetic or hyperkinetic (K) behaviour (AS/KS group), suggesting signs of dopaminergic activation. The rigidity was considerably decreased in both groups after 20 days' treatment. In a further series of experiments, haloperidol (0.2 mg/kg i.p.) was used in order to block the dopaminergic activation and to estimate the real degree of the tolerance to the rigidity without any dopaminergic interference. Haloperidol enhanced the rigidity in the A group. However, the level in the AS/KS group remained considerably lower than in the A group. The results suggest that rigidity, which is assumed to be due to an action of morphine in the striatum, can be antagonized by another process leading to dopaminergic activation in the striatum. Nevertheless, there occurs some real tolerance to this effect. The rapid alternations of rigidity and the signs of dopaminergic activation observed in the animals of the AS/KS group might be due to rapid shifts in the predominance of various DA-innervated structures.;neurological

Serotonin reuptake inhibitors, paranoia, and the ventral basal ganglia.;Antidepressants have previously been associated with paranoid reactions in psychiatric patients. Five cases of paranoid exacerbation with the serotonin reuptake inhibitors fluoxetine and amitriptyline are reported here. Elements common to these cases included a history of paranoid symptomatology and the concomitant occurrence of depressive and psychotic symptoms. Complicated depressive disorders (including atypicality of course and symptomatology, chronicity, psychosis, bipolarity, and secondary onset in the course of a primary psychosis) may present particular vulnerability to paranoid exacerbations associated with serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Although the pharmacology and neurobiology of paranoia remain cryptic, several mechanisms, including 5HT3 receptor-mediated dopamine release, beta-noradrenergic receptor downregulation, or GABAB receptor upregulation acting in the vicinity of the ventral basal ganglia (possibly in lateral orbitofrontal or anterior cingulate circuits), might apply to this phenomenon. These cases call attention to possible paranoid exacerbations with serotonin reuptake blockers in select patients and raise neurobiological considerations regarding paranoia.;neurological

Segregation distortion in myotonic dystrophy.;Myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) is an autosomal dominant disease which , in the typical pedigree , shows a three generation anticipation cascade . This results in infertility and congenital myotonic dystrophy ( CDM ) with the disappearance of DM in that pedigree . The concept of segregation distortion , where there is preferential transmission of the larger allele at the DM locus , has been put forward to explain partially the maintenance of DM in the population . In a survey of DM in Northern Ireland , 59 pedigrees were ascertained . Sibships where the status of all the members had been identified were examined to determine the transmission of the DM expansion from affected parents to their offspring . Where the transmitting parent was male , 58 . 3 % of the offspring were affected , and in the case of a female transmitting parent , 68 . 7 % were affected . Studies on meiotic drive in DM have shown increased transmission of the larger allele at the DM locus in non-DM heterozygotes for CTGn .

A dystonia-like syndrome after neuropeptide (MSH/ACTH) stimulation of the rat locus ceruleus.;"The movement disorder investigated in these studies has some features in common with human idiopathic dystonia, and information obtained in these studies may be of potential clinical benefit.

However, it is not certain as to the following: (a) what receptors were stimulated by the ACTH N-terminal fragments at the LC that resulted in this disorder; (b) whether NE, released onto Purkinje cell synapses located at terminals of the ceruleo-cerebellar pathway, did indeed cause the long-term depression at Purkinje cell synapses (previously described by others) that resulted in the long duration of the movement disorder; (c) whether the inhibition of inhibitory Purkinje cells resulted in disinhibition or increased excitability of the unilateral cerebellar fastigial or interpositus nuclei, the output targets of the Purkinje cell axons, that may have been an important contributing factor to this disorder.

Damage of substantia nigra pars reticulata during pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus in the rat: immunohistochemical study of neurons, astrocytes and serum-protein extravasation.;The substantia nigra has a gating function controlling the spread of epileptic seizure activity.

In this study, status epilepticus was induced by systemic injection of pilocarpine in rats. The neuropathology of SNR was investigated using immunohistochemical techniques with the major emphasis on the time-course of changes in neurons and astrocytes. Animals surviving 20, 30, 40, 60 min, 2, 3, 6 hours, 1, 2, and 3 days after induction of status epilepticus were perfusion-fixed, and brains processed for immunohistochemical staining of SNR. Nissl-staining and antibodies against the neuron-specific calcium-binding protein, parvalbumin, served to detect neuronal damage in SNR. Antibodies against the astroglia-specific cytoskeletal protein, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and against the glial calcium-binding protein, S-100 protein, were used to assess the status of astrocytes. Immunohistochemical staining for serum-albumin and immunoglobulins in brain tissue was taken as indicator of blood-brain barrier disturbances and vasogenic edema formation. Immunohistochemical staining indicated loss of GFAP-staining already at 30 min after induction of seizures in an oval focus situated in the center of SNR while sparing medial and lateral aspects. At 1 h there was additional vacuolation in S-100 protein staining. By 2 hours, parvalbumin-staining changed in the central SNR indicating neuronal damage, and Nissl-staining visualized some neuronal distortion. Staining for serum-proteins occurred in a patchy manner throughout the forebrain during the first hours. By 6 h, vasogenic edema covered the lesioned SNR. By 24 h, glial and neuronal markers indicated a massive lesion in the center of SNR. By 48-72 h, astrocytes surrounding the lesion increased in size, and polymorphic phagocytotic cells invaded the damaged area. In a further group of animals surviving 1 to 5 days, conventional paraffin-sections confirmed the neuronal and glial damage of SNR. Additional pathology of similar quality was found in the globus pallidus. Since astrocytes were always damaged in parallel with neurons in SNR it is proposed that the anatomical and functional interrelationship between neurons and astrocytes is particularly tight in SNR. Both cell elements may suffer in common from metabolic disturbance and neurotransmitter dysfunction as occur during massive status epilepticus.;neurological

Seizures associated with levofloxacin: case presentation and literature review.;PURPOSE: We present a case of a patient who developed seizures shortly after initiating treatment with levofloxacin and to discuss the potential drug-drug interactions related to the inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 in this case, as well as in other cases, of levofloxacin-induced seizures. METHODS: Several biomedical databases were searched including MEDLINE, Cochrane and Ovid. The main search terms utilized were case report and levofloxacin. The search was limited to studies published in English. RESULTS: Six cases of levofloxacin-induced seizures have been reported in the literature. Drug-drug interactions related to the inhibition of CYP1A2 by levofloxacin are likely involved in the clinical outcome of these cases. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians are exhorted to pay close attention when initiating levofloxacin therapy in patients taking medications with epileptogenic properties that are CYP1A2 substrates.;neurological

Mutations associated with variant phenotypes in ataxia-telangiectasia.;We have identified 14 families with ataxia-telangiectasia ( A-T ) in which mutation of the ATM gene is associated with a less severe clinical and cellular phenotype ( approximately 10 % -15 % of A-T families identified in the United Kingdom ) . In 10 of these families , all the homozygotes have a 137-bp insertion in their cDNA caused by a point mutation in a sequence resembling a splice-donor site . The second A-T allele has a different mutation in each patient . We show that the less severe phenotype in these patients is caused by some degree of normal splicing , which occurs as an alternative product from the insertion-containing allele . The level of the 137-bp PCR product containing the insertion was lowest in two patients who showed a later onset of cerebellar ataxia . A further four families who do not have this insertion have been identified . Mutations detected in two of four of these are missense mutations , normally rare in A-T patients . The demonstration of mutations giving rise to a slightly milder phenotype in A-T raises the interesting question of what range of phenotypes might occur in individuals in whom both mutations are milder . One possibility might be that individuals who are compound heterozygotes for ATM mutations are more common than we realize . .;neurological

Effect of nifedipine on renal function in liver transplant recipients receiving tacrolimus.;The effect of nifedipine on renal function in liver transplant recipients who were receiving tacrolimus was evaluated between January 1992 and January 1996. Two groups of patients receiving tacrolimus were compared over a period of 1 year, one group comprising hypertensive patients who were receiving nifedipine, and the other comprising nonhypertensive patients not receiving nifedipine. The time from transplant to baseline was similar in all patients. Nifedipine significantly improved kidney function as indicated by a significant lowering of serum creatinine levels at 6 and 12 months. The observed positive impact of nifedipine on reducing the nephrotoxicity associated with tacrolimus in liver transplant recipients should be an important factor in selecting an agent to treat hypertension in this population.;cardiovascular|hepatorenal

Function of an axonal chemoattractant modulated by metalloprotease activity.;The axonal chemoattractant netrin-1 guides spinal commissural axons by activating its receptor DCC ( Deleted in Colorectal Cancer ) . We have found that chemical inhibitors of metalloproteases potentiate netrin-mediated axon outgrowth in vitro . We have also found that DCC is a substrate for metalloprotease-dependent ectodomain shedding , and that the inhibitors block proteolytic processing of DCC and cause an increase in DCC protein levels on axons within spinal cord explants . Thus , potentiation of netrin activity by inhibitors may result from stabilization of DCC on the axons , and proteolytic activity may regulate axon migration by controlling the number of functional extracellular axon guidance receptors . .;oncological

Prenatal dexamethasone programs hypertension and renal injury in the rat.;"Dexamethasone is frequently administered to the developing fetus to accelerate pulmonary development. The purpose of the present study was to determine if prenatal dexamethasone programmed a progressive increase in blood pressure and renal injury in rats. Pregnant rats were given either vehicle or 2 daily intraperitoneal injections of dexamethasone (0.2 mg/kg body weight) on gestational days 11 and 12, 13 and 14, 15 and 16, 17 and 18, or 19 and 20. Offspring of rats administered dexamethasone on days 15 and 16 gestation had a 20% reduction in glomerular number compared with control at 6 to 9 months of age (22 527+/-509 versus 28 050+/-561, P<0.05), which was comparable to the percent reduction in glomeruli measured at 3 weeks of age. Six- to 9-month old rats receiving prenatal dexamethasone on days 17 and 18 of gestation had a 17% reduction in glomeruli (23 380+/-587) compared with control rats (P<0.05). Male rats that received prenatal dexamethasone on days 15 and 16, 17 and 18, and 13 and 14 of gestation had elevated blood pressures at 6 months of age; the latter group did not have a reduction in glomerular number. Adult rats given dexamethasone on days 15 and 16 of gestation had more glomeruli with glomerulosclerosis than control rats. This study shows that prenatal dexamethasone in rats results in a reduction in glomerular number, glomerulosclerosis, and hypertension when administered at specific points during gestation. Hypertension was observed in animals that had a reduction in glomeruli as well as in a group that did not have a reduction in glomerular number, suggesting that a reduction in glomerular number is not the sole cause for the development of hypertension.";neurological|cardiovascular|hepatorenal

Relation of perfusion defects observed with myocardial contrast echocardiography to the severity of coronary stenosis: correlation with thallium-201 single-photon emission tomography.;"It has been previously shown that myocardial contrast echocardiography is a valuable technique for delineating regions of myocardial underperfusion secondary to coronary occlusion and to critical coronary stenoses in the presence of hyperemic stimulation. The aim of this study was to determine whether myocardial contrast echocardiography performed with a stable solution of sonicated albumin could detect regions of myocardial underperfusion resulting from various degrees of coronary stenosis. The perfusion defect produced in 16 open chest dogs was compared with the anatomic area at risk measured by the postmortem dual-perfusion technique and with thallium-201 single-photon emission tomography (SPECT). During a transient (20-s) coronary occlusion, a perfusion defect was observed with contrast echocardiography in 14 of the 15 dogs in which the occlusion was produced. The perfusion defect correlated significantly with the anatomic area at risk (r = 0.74; p less than 0.002). During dipyridamole-induced hyperemia, 12 of the 16 dogs with a partial coronary stenosis had a visible area of hypoperfusion by contrast echocardiography. The four dogs without a perfusion defect had a stenosis that resulted in a mild (0% to 50%) reduction in dipyridamole-induced hyperemia. The size of the perfusion defect during stenosis correlated significantly with the anatomic area at risk (r = 0.61; p = 0.02). Thallium-201 SPECT demonstrated a perfusion defect in all 14 dogs analyzed during dipyridamole-induced hyperemia; the size of the perfusion defect correlated with the anatomic area at risk (r = 0.58; p less than 0.03) and with the perfusion defect by contrast echocardiography (r = 0.58; p less than 0.03). Thus, myocardial contrast echocardiography can be used to visualize and quantitate the amount of jeopardized myocardium during moderate to severe degrees of coronary stenosis. The results obtained show a correlation with the anatomic area at risk similar to that obtained with thallium-201 SPECT.";cardiovascular

Investigation of mitochondrial involvement in the experimental model of epilepsy induced by pilocarpine.;Mitochondrial abnormalities have been associated with several aspects of epileptogenesis, such as energy generation, control of cell death, neurotransmitter synthesis, and free radical (FR) production. Increased production of FRs may cause mtDNA damage leading to decreased activities of oxidative phosphorylation complexes containing mtDNA-encoded subunits. In this study, we investigated whether increased generation of FR during status epilepticus would be sufficient to provoke abnormalities in mtDNA and in the expression and activity of cytochrome c oxidase (CCO), complex IV of the respiratory chain, in the chronic phase of the pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy. DNA analysis revealed low amounts of a 4.8 kb mtDNA deletion but with no differences in frequency or quantity in the control and experimental groups. We did not find abnormalities in the expression and distribution of an mtDNA-encoded subunit of CCO (CCO-I) or a relative decrease in CCO-I when compared with nuclear-encoded subunits (CCO-IV and SDH-fp). No abnormality in CCO activity was observed through histochemistry. Although evidences of mitochondrial abnormalities were found in previously published studies, our results do not suggest that the FRs, generated during the acute phase, determined important abnormalities in mtDNA, in expression of CCO-I, and in CCO activity.;neurological
Alpha and beta coma in drug intoxication uncomplicated by cerebral hypoxia.;Four patients who were rendered comatose or stuporous by drug intoxication, but who were not hypoxic, are described. Three patients received high doses of chlormethiazole for alcohol withdrawal symptoms, and one took a suicidal overdose of nitrazepam. The patient with nitrazepam overdose and two of those with chlormethiazole intoxication conformed to the criteria of 'alpha coma', showing non-reactive generalized or frontally predominant alpha activity in the EEG. The fourth patient who was unconscious after chlormethiazole administration exhibite generalized non-reactive activity in the slow beta range. All four recovered completely without neurological sequelae following the withdrawal of the offending agents. The similarities between the effects of structural lesions and pharmacological depression of the brain stem reticular formation are discussed. It is suggested that in both situations disturbed reticulo-thalamic interactions are important in the pathogenesis of alpha coma. It is concluded that when this electroencephalographic and behavioural picture is seen in drug intoxication, in the absence of significant hypoxaemia, a favourable outcome may be anticipated.;neurological

Use of argatroban and catheter-directed thrombolysis with alteplase in an oncology patient with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis.;"PURPOSE: The case of an oncology patient who developed heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT) and was treated with argatroban plus catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) with alteplase is presented. SUMMARY: A 63-year-old Caucasian man with renal amyloidosis undergoing peripheral blood stem cell collection for an autologous stem cell transplant developed extensive bilateral upper-extremity deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism secondary to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. A continuous i.v. infusion of argatroban was initiated, and the patient was managed on the general medical floor. After one week of therapy, he was transferred to the intensive care unit with cardiopulmonary compromise related to superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. A percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy and CDT with alteplase were attempted, but the procedure was aborted due to epistaxis. The epistaxis resolved the next day, and the patient was restarted on argatroban. A second percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy was performed six days later and resulted in partial revascularization of the SVC and central veins. Postthrombectomy continuous CDT with alteplase was commenced while argatroban was withheld, and complete patency of the SVC and central veins was achieved after three days of therapy. Alteplase was discontinued, and the patient was reinitiated on argatroban; ultimately, he was transitioned to warfarin for long-term anticoagulation. Although the patient recovered, he experienced permanent vision and hearing loss, as well as end-stage renal disease. CONCLUSION: A 63-year-old man with renal amyloidosis and SVC syndrome secondary to HITT was successfully treated with argatroban and CDT with alteplase.";cardiovascular|hepatorenal

Involvement of locus coeruleus and noradrenergic neurotransmission in fentanyl-induced muscular rigidity in the rat.;Whereas muscular rigidity is a well-known side effect that is associated with high-dose fentanyl anesthesia, a paucity of information exists with regard to its underlying mechanism(s). We investigated in this study the possible engagement of locus coeruleus of the pons in this phenomenon, using male Sprague-Dawley rats anesthetized with ketamine. Under proper control of respiration, body temperature and end-tidal CO2, intravenous administration of fentanyl (50 or 100 micrograms/kg) consistently promoted an increase in electromyographic activity recorded from the gastrocnemius and abdominal rectus muscles. Such an induced muscular rigidity by the narcotic agent was significantly antagonized or even reduced by prior electrolytic lesions of the locus coeruleus or pretreatment with the alpha-adrenoceptor blocker, prazosin. Microinjection of fentanyl (2.5 micrograms/50 nl) directly into this pontine nucleus, on the other hand, elicited discernible electromyographic excitation. It is speculated that the induction of muscular rigidity by fentanyl may involve the coerulospinal noradrenergic fibers to the spinal motoneurons.;neurological
Nephrotoxic effects of aminoglycoside treatment on renal protein reabsorption and accumulation.;To quantify the effects of gentamicin, kanamycin and netilmicin on renal protein reabsorption and accumulation, these drugs were administered to rats intraperitoneally (30 mg/kg/day) for 7, 14 or 21 days. Scanning electron microscopy of the glomerular endothelia, urinary measurements of sodium, potassium, endogenous lysozyme, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) as well as clearance and accumulation experiments after i.v. administration of egg-white lysozyme and measurements of inulin clearance (GFR) were done in each treatment group. Gentamicin administration decreased diameter, density and shape of endothelial fenestrae. Kanamycin and netilmicin appeared to have no effect at the dose used. All three aminoglycosides decreased GFR and increased urinary excretion of sodium and potassium. While gentamicin and kanamycin decreased the percentage reabsorption and accumulation of lysozyme after i.v. administration of egg-white lysozyme netilmicin had no effect. Daily excretion of total protein, endogenous lysozyme and NAG increased only after treatment with kanamycin and gentamicin. Thus, aminoglycosides may act as nephrotoxicants at glomerular and/or tubular level inducing impairment of renal reabsorption and accumulation of proteins.;hepatorenal

Previous family studies suggested that these individuals may be compound heterozygotes for the common mutant TSD gene and a rare ( allelic ) mutant gene . Thus , the postulated rate mutant gene appears to code for the expression of low amounts of hex A . Heterozygotes for the rare mutant may be indistinguishable from heterozygotes for the common TSD mutant . However , direct visualization and quantitation of hex A by the methods described may prevent false-positive prenatal diagnosis of TSD in fetuses having the incomplete hex A deficiency of the type described in the four healthy individuals;oncological

Diagnosis of hemochromatosis.;If untreated , hemochromatosis can cause serious illness and early death , but the disease is still substantially under-diagnosed . The cornerstone of screening and case detection is the measurement of serum transferrin saturation and the serum ferritin level . Once the diagnosis is suspected , physicians must use serum ferritin levels and hepatic iron stores on liver biopsy specimens to assess patients for the presence of iron overload . Liver biopsy is also used to establish the presence or absence of cirrhosis , which can affect prognosis and management . A DNA-based test for the HFE gene is commercially available , but its place in the diagnosis of hemochromatosis is still being evaluated . Currently , the most useful role for this test is in the detection of hemochromatosis in the family members of patients with a proven case of the disease .

Liver-specific ablation of integrin-linked kinase in mice results in enhanced and prolonged cell proliferation and hepatomegaly after phenobarbital administration.;We have recently demonstrated that disruption of extracellular matrix (ECM)/integrin signaling via elimination of integrin-linked kinase (ILK) in hepatocytes interferes with signals leading to termination of liver regeneration. This study investigates the role of ILK in liver enlargement induced by phenobarbital (PB). Wild-type (WT) and ILK:liver-/- mice were given PB (0.1% in drinking water) for 10 days. Livers were harvested on 2, 5, and 10 days during PB administration. In the hepatocyte-specific ILK/liver-/- mice, the liver:body weight ratio was more than double as compared to 0 h at day 2 (2.5 times), while at days 5 and 10, it was enlarged three times. In the WT mice, the increase was as expected from previous literature (1.8 times) and seems to have leveled off after day 2. There were slightly increased proliferating cell nuclear antigen-positive cells in the ILK/liver-/- animals at day 2 as compared to WT after PB administration. In the WT animals, the proliferative response had come back to normal by days 5 and 10. Hepatocytes of the ILK/liver-/- mice continued to proliferate up until day 10. ILK/liver-/- mice also showed increased expression of key genes involved in hepatocyte proliferation at different time points during PB administration. In summary, ECM proteins communicate with the signaling machinery of dividing cells via ILK to regulate hepatocyte proliferation and termination of the proliferative response. Lack of ILK in the hepatocytes imparts prolonged proliferative response not only to stimuli related to liver regeneration but also to xenobiotic chemical mitogens, such as PB.;neurological|hepatorenal

Lamivudine is effective in suppressing hepatitis B virus DNA in Chinese hepatitis B surface antigen carriers: a placebo-controlled trial.;Lamivudine is a novel 2',3'-dideoxy cytosine analogue that has potent inhibitory effects on hepatitis B virus replication in vitro and in vivo. We performed a single-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess its effectiveness and safety in Chinese hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) carriers. Forty-two Chinese HBsAg carriers were randomized to receive placebo (6 patients) or lamivudine orally in dosages of 25 mg, 100 mg, or 300 mg daily (12 patients for each dosage). The drug was given for 4 weeks. The patients were closely monitored clinically, biochemically, and serologically up to 4 weeks after drug treatment. All 36 patients receiving lamivudine had a decrease in hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA values of >90% (P < .001 compared with placebo). Although 25 mg of lamivudine was slightly less effective than 100 mg (P = .011) and 300 mg (P = .005), it still induced 94% suppression of HBV DNA after the fourth week of therapy. HBV DNA values returned to pretreatment levels within 4 weeks of cessation of therapy. There was no change in the hepatitis B e antigen status or in aminotransferase levels. No serious adverse events were observed. In conclusion, a 4-week course of lamivudine was safe and effective in suppression of HBV DNA in Chinese HBsAg carriers. The suppression was >90% but reversible. Studies with long-term lamivudine administration should be performed to determine if prolonged suppression of HBV DNA can be achieved.;hepatorenal

The 225 mg/m2 level was expanded for the phase II study since the highest level achieved (250 mg/m2) required modification because of nonhematologic toxicities (arthralgia and sensory neuropathy). Therapeutic effects were noted at all dose levels, with objective responses in 17 (two complete and 15 partial regressions) of 41 previously untreated patients. Toxicities were compared with a cohort of patients in a phase I trial of paclitaxel alone at identical dose levels. Carboplatin did not appear to add to the hematologic toxicities observed, and the paclitaxel/carboplatin combination could be dosed every 3 weeks.";neurological|oncological
The activation of spinal N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors may contribute to degeneration of spinal motor neurons induced by neuraxial morphine after a noninjurious interval of spinal cord ischemia.;"We investigated the relationship between the degeneration of spinal motor neurons and activation of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors after neuraxial morphine following a noninjurious interval of aortic occlusion in rats. Spinal cord ischemia was induced by aortic occlusion for 6 min with a balloon catheter. In a microdialysis study, 10 muL of saline (group C; n = 8) or 30 mug of morphine (group M; n = 8) was injected intrathecally (IT) 0.5 h after reflow, and 30 mug of morphine (group SM; n = 8) or 10 muL of saline (group SC; n = 8) was injected IT 0.5 h after sham operation. Microdialysis samples were collected preischemia, before IT injection, and at 2, 4, 8, 24, and 48 h of reperfusion (after IT injection). Second, we investigated the effect of IT MK-801 (30 mug) on the histopathologic changes in the spinal cord after morphine-induced spastic paraparesis. After IT morphine, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glutamate concentration was increased in group M relative to both baseline and group C (P < 0.05). This increase persisted for 8 hrs. IT MK-801 significantly reduced the number of dark-stained alpha-motoneurons after morphine-induced spastic paraparesis compared with the saline group. These data indicate that IT morphine induces spastic paraparesis with a concomitant increase in CSF glutamate, which is involved in NMDA receptor activation. We suggest that opioids may be neurotoxic in the setting of spinal cord ischemia via NMDA receptor activation.";neurological|cardiovascular
PTU-associated vasculitis in a girl with Turner Syndrome and Graves' disease.;Palpable purpura is a concerning clinical finding in pediatric patients and can have many causes, including infectious and autoimmune processes. A rare cause, drug-induced vasculitis, may result from the production of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) in response to a medication. We report a girl with Turner syndrome and Graves' disease who presented with palpable purpuric lesions. The diagnosis of propylthiouracil (PTU)-associated vasculitis was made by observation of consistent clinical features, the detection of elevated ANA and ANCA in the blood, and the observed clinical resolution of symptoms following withdrawal of PTU. Subsequent treatment of persistent hyperthyroidism with radioablation did not result in an exacerbation of the vasculitis, a complication described in prior case reports.;neurological

Prolonged cholestasis after troleandomycin-induced acute hepatitis.;We report the case of a patient in whom troleandomycin-induced hepatitis was followed by prolonged anicteric cholestasis. Jaundice occurred after administration of troleandomycin for 7 days and was associated with hypereosinophilia. Jaundice disappeared within 3 months but was followed by prolonged anicteric cholestasis marked by pruritus and high levels of alkaline phosphatase and gammaglutamyltransferase activities. Finally, pruritus disappeared within 19 months, and liver tests returned to normal 27 months after the onset of hepatitis. This observation demonstrates that prolonged cholestasis can follow troleandomycin-induced acute hepatitis.;hepatorenal
Detection of heterozygous carriers of the ataxia-telangiectasia (ATM) gene by G2 phase chromosomal radiosensitivity of peripheral blood lymphocytes.;In ataxia-telangiectasia ( A-T ) patients , mutations in a single gene , ATM , result in an autosomal recessive syndrome that embraces a variety of clinical features and manifests extreme radiosensitivity and a strong pre-disposition to malignancy . Heterozygotes for the ATM gene have no clinical expression of A-T but may be cancer prone with a moderate increase in in vitro radiosensitivity . We performed a blind chromosomal analysis on G2-phase lymphocytes from 7 unrelated A-T patients , 13 obligate A-T heterozygotes ( parents of the patients ) , and 14 normal controls following X-irradiation with 1 Gy in order to evaluate this cytogenetic method as a tool for detection of ATM carriers . Both A-T homozygotes and heterozygotes showed significantly increased levels of radiation-induced chromatid damage relative to that of normal controls . These results show that the G2-phase chromosomal radiosensitivity assay can be used for the detection of A-T heterozygotes . In combination with molecular genetic analyses , this test may be of value in studies of familial and sporadic cancers aimed at determination of the potential involvement of ATM mutations in tumor risk or development . .;neurological|oncological

Spectrum of adverse events after generic HAART in southern Indian HIV-infected patients.;"To determine the incidence of clinically significant adverse events after long-term, fixed-dose, generic highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) use among HIV-infected individuals in South India, we examined the experiences of 3154 HIV-infected individuals who received a minimum of 3 months of generic HAART between February 1996 and December 2006 at a tertiary HIV care referral center in South India. The most common regimens were 3TC + d4T + nevirapine (NVP) (54.8%), zidovudine (AZT) + 3TC + NVP (14.5%), 3TC + d4T + efavirenz (EFV) (20.1%), and AZT + 3TC + EFV (5.4%). The most common adverse events and median CD4 at time of event were rash (15.2%; CD4, 285 cells/microL) and peripheral neuropathy (9.0% and 348 cells/microL). Clinically significant anemia (hemoglobin <7 g/dL) was observed in 5.4% of patients (CD4, 165 cells/microL) and hepatitis (clinical jaundice with alanine aminotransferase > 5 times upper limits of normal) in 3.5% of patients (CD4, 260 cells/microL). Women were significantly more likely to experience lactic acidosis, while men were significantly more likely to experience immune reconstitution syndrome (p < 0.05). Among the patients with 1 year of follow-up, NVP therapy was significantly associated with developing rash and d4T therapy with developing peripheral neuropathy (p < 0.05). Anemia and hepatitis often occur within 12 weeks of initiating generic HAART. Frequent and early monitoring for these toxicities is warranted in developing countries where generic HAART is increasingly available.";neurological|hepatorenal

Hemodynamics and myocardial metabolism under deliberate hypotension. An experimental study in dogs.;Coronary blood flow, cardiac work and metabolism were studied in dogs under sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and trimetaphan (TMP) deliberate hypotension (20% and 40% mean pressure decrease from baseline). Regarding the effects of drug-induced hypotension on coronary blood flow, aortic and coronary sinus metabolic data (pH, pO2, pCO2) we could confirm that nitroprusside hypotension could be safely used to 30% mean blood pressure decrease from control, trimetaphan hypotension to 20% mean blood pressure decrease. Cardiac work was significantly reduced during SNP hypotension. Myocardial O2 consumption and O2 availability were directly dependent on the coronary perfusion. Careful invasive monitoring of the blood pressure, blood gases and of the ECG ST-T segment is mandatory.;cardiovascular

Memory function and serotonin transporter promoter gene polymorphism in ecstasy (MDMA) users.;"Although 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ecstasy) has been shown to damage brain serotonin (5-HT) neurons in animals and possibly humans, little is known about the long-term consequences of MDMA-induced 5-HT neurotoxic lesions on functions in which 5-HT is involved, such as cognitive function. Because 5-HT transporters play a key element in the regulation of synaptic 5-HT transmission it may be important to control for the potential covariance effect of a polymorphism in the 5-HT transporter promoter gene region (5-HTTLPR) when studying the effects of MDMA as well as cognitive functioning. The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of moderate and heavy MDMA use on cognitive function, as well as the effects of long-term abstention from MDMA, in subjects genotyped for 5-HTTLPR. A second aim of the study was to determine whether these effects differ for females and males. Fifteen moderate MDMA users (<55 lifetime tablets), 22 heavy MDMA+ users (>55 lifetime tablets), 16 ex-MDMA+ users (last tablet > 1 year ago) and 13 controls were compared on a battery of neuropsychological tests. DNA from peripheral nuclear blood cells was genotyped for 5-HTTLPR using standard polymerase chain reaction methods.A significant group effect was observed only on memory function tasks (p = 0.04) but not on reaction times (p = 0.61) or attention/executive functioning (p = 0.59). Heavy and ex-MDMA+ users performed significantly poorer on memory tasks than controls. In contrast, no evidence of memory impairment was observed in moderate MDMA users. No significant effect of 5-HTTLPR or gender was observed. While the use of MDMA in quantities that may be considered ""moderate"" is not associated with impaired memory functioning, heavy use of MDMA use may lead to long lasting memory impairments. No effect of 5-HTTLPR or gender on memory function or MDMA use was observed.";neurological
Glial activation and post-synaptic neurotoxicity: the key events in Streptozotocin (ICV) induced memory impairment in rats.;"In the present study the role of glial activation and post synaptic toxicity in ICV Streptozotocin (STZ) induced memory impaired rats was explored. In experiment set up 1: Memory deficit was found in Morris water maze test on 14-16 days after STZ (ICV; 3mg/Kg) administration. STZ causes increased expression of GFAP, CD11b and TNF-a indicating glial activation and neuroinflammation. STZ also significantly increased the level of ROS, nitrite, Ca(2+) and reduced the mitochondrial activity in synaptosomal preparation illustrating free radical generation and excitotoxicity. Increased expression and activity of Caspase-3 was also observed in STZ treated rat which specify apoptotic cell death in hippocampus and cortex. STZ treatment showed decrease expression of post synaptic markers CaMKIIa and PSD-95, while, expression of pre synaptic markers (synaptophysin and SNAP-25) remains unaltered indicating selective post synaptic neurotoxicity. Oral treatment with Memantine (10mg/kg) and Ibuprofen (50 mg/kg) daily for 13 days attenuated STZ induced glial activation, apoptotic cell death and post synaptic neurotoxicity in rat brain. Further, in experiment set up 2: where memory function was not affected i.e. 7-9 days after STZ treatment. The level of GFAP, CD11b, TNF-a, ROS and nitrite levels were increased. On the other hand, apoptotic marker, synaptic markers, mitochondrial activity and Ca(2+) levels remained unaffected. Collective data indicates that neuroinflammatory process and oxidative stress occurs earlier to apoptosis and does not affect memory function. Present study clearly suggests that glial activation and post synaptic neurotoxicity are the key factors in STZ induced memory impairment and neuronal cell death.";neurological

Respiratory pattern in a rat model of epilepsy.;PURPOSE: Apnea is known to occur during seizures, but systematic studies of ictal respiratory changes in adults are few. Data regarding respiratory pattern defects during interictal periods also are scarce. Here we sought to generate information with regard to the interictal period in animals with pilocarpine-induced epilepsy. METHODS: Twelve rats (six chronically epileptic animals and six controls) were anesthetized, given tracheotomies, and subjected to hyperventilation or hypoventilation conditions. Breathing movements caused changes in thoracic volume and forced air to flow tidally through a pneumotachograph. This flow was measured by using a differential pressure transducer, passed through a polygraph, and from this to a computer with custom software that derived ventilation (VE), tidal volume (VT), inspiratory time (TI), expiratory time (TE), breathing frequency (f), and mean inspiratory flow (VT/TI) on a breath-by-breath basis. RESULTS: The hyperventilation maneuver caused a decrease in spontaneous ventilation in pilocarpine-treated and control rats. Although VE had a similar decrease in both groups, in the epileptic group, the decrease in VE was due to a significant (p < 0.05) increase in TE peak in relation to that of the control animals. The hypoventilation maneuver led to an increase in the arterial Paco2, followed by an increase in VE. In the epileptic group, the increase in VE was mediated by a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in TE peak compared with the control group. Systemic application of KCN, to evaluate the effects of peripheral chemoreception activation on ventilation, led to a similar increase in VE for both groups. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that pilocarpine-treated animals have an altered ability to react to (or compensate for) blood gas changes with changes in ventilation and suggest that it is centrally determined. We speculate on the possible relation of the current findings on treating different epilepsy-associated conditions.;neurological

Prevalence of p16 and CDK4 germline mutations in 48 melanoma-prone families in France.;The French Familial Melanoma Study Group. Germline mutations in the p16 and CDK4 genes have been reported in a subset of melanoma pedigrees , but their prevalence is not well known . We searched for such germline mutations in 48 French melanoma-prone families selected according to two major criteria  families with at least three affected members ( n = 20 ) or families with two affected members , one of them affected before the age of 50 ( n = 28 ) , and one additional minor criterion . Sixteen different p16 germline mutations were found in 21 families , while one germline mutation , Arg24His , was detected in the CDK4 gene . The frequency of p16 gene mutation in our sample ( 44 % ) is among the highest rates yet reported and the CDK4 mutation is the second mutation detected in this gene worldwide . In summary , our results show frequent involvement of the p16 gene in familial melanoma and confirm the role of the CDK4 gene as a melanoma-predisposing gene . .;oncological

Probing peripheral and central cholinergic system responses.;"OBJECTIVE: The pharmacological response to drugs that act on the cholinergic system of the iris has been used to predict deficits in central cholinergic functioning due to diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, yet correlations between central and peripheral responses have not been properly studied. This study assessed the effect of normal aging on (1) the tropicamide-induced increase in pupil diameter, and (2) the reversal of this effect with pilocarpine. Scopolamine was used as a positive control to detect age-dependent changes in central cholinergic functioning in the elderly. DESIGN: Randomized double-blind controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: Ten healthy elderly (mean age 70) and 9 young (mean age 33) volunteers. INTERVENTIONS: Pupil diameter was monitored using a computerized infrared pupillometer over 4 hours. The study involved 4 sessions. In 1 session, tropicamide (20 microL, 0.01%) was administered to one eye and placebo to the other. In another session, tropicamide (20 microL, 0.01%) was administered to both eyes, followed 23 minutes later by the application of pilocarpine (20 microL, 0.1%) to one eye and placebo to the other. All eye drops were given in a randomized order. In 2 separate sessions, a single dose of scopolamine (0.5 mg, intravenously) or placebo was administered, and the effects on word recall were measured using the Buschke Selective Reminding Test over 2 hours. OUTCOME MEASURES: Pupil size at time points after administration of tropicamide and pilocarpine; scopolamine-induced impairment in word recall. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between elderly and young volunteers in pupillary response to tropicamide at any time point (p > 0.05). The elderly group had a significantly greater pilocarpine-induced net decrease in pupil size 85, 125, 165 and 215 minutes after administration, compared with the young group (p < 0.05). Compared with the young group, the elderly group had greater scopolamine-induced impairment in word recall 60, 90 and 120 minutes after administration (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: There is an age-related pupillary response to pilocarpine that is not found with tropicamide. Thus, pilocarpine may be useful to assess variations in central cholinergic function in elderly patients.";neurological

Evidence for an involvement of D1 and D2 dopamine receptors in mediating nicotine-induced hyperactivity in rats.;Previous studies have suggested that repeated exposure of rats to the drug or to the experimental environment is necessary to observe nicotine-induced locomotor stimulation. In the present study the role of habituation to the experimental environment on the stimulant effect of nicotine in rats was examined. In addition, the role of dopamine receptors in mediating nicotine-induced locomotor stimulation was investigated by examining the effects of selective D1 and D2 dopamine receptor antagonists on activity induced by nicotine. Locomotor activity was assessed in male Sprague-Dawley rats tested in photocell cages. Nicotine (1.0 mg/kg) caused a significant increase in locomotor activity in rats that were habituated to the test environment, but had only a weak and delayed stimulant action in rats that were unfamiliar with the test environment. The stimulant action of nicotine was blocked by the central nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine but not by the peripheral nicotinic blocker hexamethonium, indicating that the response is probably mediated by central nicotinic receptors. Nicotine-induced hyperactivity was blocked by the selective D1 antagonist SCH 23390, the selective D2 antagonist raclopride and the D1/D2 antagonist fluphenazine. Pretreatment with the D2 agonist PHNO enhanced nicotine-induced hyperactivity, whereas the D1 agonist SKF 38393 had no effect. The results indicate that acute nicotine injection induces a pronounced hyperactivity in rats habituated to the test environment. The effect appears to be mediated by central nicotine receptors, possibly located on dopaminergic neurons, and also requires the activation of both D1 and D2 dopamine receptors.;neurological

However , his intelligence was normal and he had no evidence of self-mutilation . There was no activity of HPRT in the lysates of erythrocytes and cultured fibroblasts when analyzed in the usual manner . Using a newly developed method for the study of purine metabolism in intact cultured cells , this patient was found to metabolize some 9 % of 8-14C-hypoxanthine , and 90 % of the isotope utilized was converted to adenine and guanine nucleotides . In contrast , cells from patients with the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome were virtually completely unable to convert hypoxanthine to nucleotides . The patients fibroblasts were even more efficient in the metabolism of 8-14C-guanine , which was utilized to the extent of 27 % , over 80 % of which was converted to guanine and adenine nucleotides . The growth of the cultured fibroblasts of this patient was intermediate in media containing hypoxanthine aminopterin thymidine ( HAT ) , whereas the growth of Lesch-Nyhan cells was inhibited and normal cells grew normally . Similarly in 8-azaguanine , 6-thioguanine , and 8-azahypoxanthine , the growth of the patients cells was intermediate between normal and Lesch-Nyhan cells . These observations provide further evidence for genetic heterogeneity among patients with disorders in purine metabolism involving the HPRT gene .

Consensus statement concerning cardiotoxicity occurring during haematopoietic stem cell transplantation in the treatment of autoimmune diseases, with special reference to systemic sclerosis and multiple sclerosis.;Autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation is now a feasible and effective treatment for selected patients with severe autoimmune diseases. Worldwide, over 650 patients have been transplanted in the context of phase I and II clinical trials. The results are encouraging enough to begin randomised phase III trials. However, as predicted, significant transplant-related morbidity and mortality have been observed. This is primarily due to complications related to either the stage of the disease at transplant or due to infections. The number of deaths related to cardiac toxicity is low. However, caution is required when cyclophosphamide or anthracyclines such as mitoxantrone are used in patients with a possible underlying heart damage, for example, systemic sclerosis patients. In November 2002, a meeting was held in Florence, bringing together a number of experts in various fields, including rheumatology, cardiology, neurology, pharmacology and transplantation medicine. The object of the meeting was to analyse existing data, both published or available, in the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation autoimmune disease database, and to propose a safe approach to such patients. A full cardiological assessment before and during the transplant emerged as the major recommendation.;neurological|cardiovascular
Relationship between nicotine-induced seizures and hippocampal nicotinic receptors.;A controversy has existed for several years concerning the physiological relevance of the nicotinic receptor measured by alpha-bungarotoxin binding. Using mice derived from a classical F2 and backcross genetic design, a relationship between nicotine-induced seizures and alpha-bungarotoxin nicotinic receptor concentration was found. Mice sensitive to the convulsant effects of nicotine had greater alpha-bungarotoxin binding in the hippocampus than seizure insensitive mice. The binding sites from seizure sensitive and resistant mice were equally affected by treatment with dithiothreitol, trypsin or heat. Thus it appears that the difference between seizure sensitive and insensitive animals may be due to a difference in hippocampal nicotinic receptor concentration as measured with alpha-bungarotoxin binding.;neurological

Persistent paralysis after prolonged use of atracurium in the absence of corticosteroids.;Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) are often used for patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation. Reports of persistent paralysis after the discontinuance of these drugs have most often involved aminosteroid-based NMBAs such as vecuronium bromide, especially when used in conjunction with corticosteroids. Atracurium besylate, a short-acting benzylisoquinolinium NMBA that is eliminated independently of renal or hepatic function, has also been associated with persistent paralysis, but only when used with corticosteroids. We report a case of atracurium-related paralysis persisting for approximately 50 hours in a patient who was not treated with corticosteroids.;neurological|hepatorenal

Maternal uniparental disomy for chromosome 14 in a boy with a normal karyotype.;We report on a boy with a maternal uniparental disomy for chromosome 14 ( UPD ( 14 ) ) . At 7 years of age he was referred to us by the paediatrician because of symptoms of Prader-Willi syndrome ( PWS ) . He showed short stature , obesity , mild developmental delay , cryptorchidism , and some mild dysmorphic features . The history further indicated intrauterine growth retardation at the end of the pregnancy . His mother was 44 years of age at the time of his birth . After birth he showed hypotonia with poor sucking , for which gavage feeding was needed . Motor development was delayed . After 1 year he became obese despite a normal appetite . Recurrent middle ear infections , a high pain threshold , and a great skill with jigsaw puzzles were reported . There were no behavioural problems or sleep disturbance . Chromosomal analysis was normal ( 46 , XY ) . DNA analysis for Prader-Willi syndrome showed no abnormalities . Two years later he was re-examined because we thought his features fitted the PWS-like phenotype associated with maternal UPD ( 14 ) . At that time precocious puberty was evident . DNA analysis showed maternal heterodisomy for chromosome 14 . In all the previously described 11 cases with maternal UPD ( 14 ) , a Robertsonian translocation involving chromosome 14 was detected cytogenetically before DNA analysis . This is the first report of diagnosis of maternal UPD ( 14 ) based on clinical features . This finding underlines the importance of DNA analysis for maternal UPD ( 14 ) in patients with a similar PWS-like phenotype even without previous identification of a Robertsonian translocation involving chromosome 14 . .;neurological
Permeability, ultrastructural changes, and distribution of novel proteins in the glomerular barrier in early puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis.;BACKGROUND/AIMS: It is still unclear what happens in the glomerulus when proteinuria starts. Using puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis (PAN) rats, we studied early ultrastructural and permeability changes in relation to the expression of the podocyte-associated molecules nephrin, a-actinin, dendrin, and plekhh2, the last two of which were only recently discovered in podocytes. METHODS: Using immune stainings, semiquantitative measurement was performed under the electron microscope. Permeability was assessed using isolated kidney perfusion with tracers. Possible effects of ACE inhibition were tested. RESULTS: By day 2, some patchy foot process effacement, but no proteinuria, appeared. The amount of nephrin was reduced in both diseased and normal areas. The other proteins showed few changes, which were limited to diseased areas. By day 4, foot process effacement was complete and proteinuria appeared in parallel with signs of size barrier damage. Nephrin decreased further, while dendrin and plekhh2 also decreased but a-actinin remained unchanged. ACE inhibition had no significant protective effect. CONCLUSIONS: PAN glomeruli already showed significant pathology by day 4, despite relatively mild proteinuria. This was preceded by altered nephrin expression, supporting its pivotal role in podocyte morphology. The novel proteins dendrin and plekhh2 were both reduced, suggesting roles in PAN, whereas a-actinin was unchanged.;neurological|hepatorenal

Estrogen prevents cholesteryl ester accumulation in macrophages induced by the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir.;Individuals with HIV can now live long lives with drug therapy that often includes protease inhibitors such as ritonavir. Many patients, however, develop negative long-term side effects such as premature atherosclerosis. We have previously demonstrated that ritonavir treatment increases atherosclerotic lesion formation in male mice to a greater extent than in female mice. Furthermore, peripheral blood monocytes isolated from ritonavir-treated females had less cholesteryl ester accumulation. In the present study, we have investigated the molecular mechanisms by which female hormones influence cholesterol metabolism in macrophages in response to the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir. We have utilized the human monocyte cell line, THP-1 as a model to address this question. Briefly, cells were differentiated for 72 h with 100 nM PMA to obtain a macrophage-like phenotype in the presence or absence of 1 nM 17beta-estradiol (E2), 100 nM progesterone or vehicle (0.01% ethanol). Cells were then treated with 30 ng/ml ritonavir or vehicle in the presence of aggregated LDL for 24 h. Cell extracts were harvested, and lipid or total RNA was isolated. E2 decreased the accumulation of cholesteryl esters in macrophages following ritonavir treatment. Ritonavir increased the expression of the scavenger receptor, CD36 mRNA, responsible for the uptake of LDL. Additionally, ritonavir treatment selectively increased the relative levels of PPARgamma mRNA, a transcription factor responsible for the regulation of CD36 mRNA expression. Treatment with E2, however, failed to prevent these increases at the mRNA level. E2 did, however, significantly suppress CD36 protein levels as measured by fluorescent immunocytochemistry. This data suggests that E2 modifies the expression of CD36 at the level of protein expression in monocyte-derived macrophages resulting in reduced cholesteryl ester accumulation following ritonavir treatment.;neurological

Differential effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on seizures produced by pilocarpine in rats.;The muscarinic cholinergic agonist pilocarpine induces in rats seizures and status epilepticus followed by widespread damage to the forebrain. The present study was designed to investigate the effect of 5 non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, sodium salicylate, phenylbutazone, indomethacin, ibuprofen and mefenamic acid, on seizures produced by pilocarpine. Pretreatment of rats with sodium salicylate, ED50 103 mg/kg (60-174), and phenylbutazone, 59 mg/kg (50-70) converted the non-convulsant dose of pilocarpine, 200 mg/kg, to a convulsant one. Indomethacin, 1-10 mg/kg, and ibuprofen, 10-100 mg/kg, failed to modulate seizures produced by pilocarpine. Mefenamic acid, 26 (22-30) mg/kg, prevented seizures and protected rats from seizure-related brain damage induced by pilocarpine, 380 mg/kg. These results indicate that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs differentially modulate the threshold for pilocarpine-induced seizures.;neurological
Clinical and histopathologic examination of renal allografts treated with tacrolimus (FK506) for at least one year.;"BACKGROUND: We clinically and pathologically analyzed renal allografts from 1 9 renal transplant patients treated with tacrolimus (FK506) for more than 1 year. METHODS: Twenty-six renal allograft biopsy specimens from 1 9 renal transplant patients who underwent transplantations between 1991 and 1993 were evaluated. Thirteen biopsies were performed from stable functioning renal allografts with informed consent (nonepisode biopsy) and the other 13 were from dysfunctional renal allografts with a clinical indication for biopsy (episode biopsy). RESULTS: The main pathologic diagnoses (some overlap) were acute rejection (AR; n = 4), chronic rejection (CR; n=5), AR+CR (n =4), recurrent IgA nephropathy (n =5), normal findings (n =2), minimal-type chronic FK506 nephropathy (n = 9), and mild-type FK506 nephropathy (n = 11). Of the nonepisode biopsies, 7 and 4 biopsies showed minimal-type and mild-type chronic FK506 nephropathy, respectively. Chronic FK506 nephropathy consisted of rough and foamy tubular vacuolization (5 biopsies), arteriolopathy (angiodegeneration of the arteriolar wall; 20 biopsies), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (4 biopsies) and the striped form of interstitial fibrosis (11 biopsies). The serum creatinine levels of patients in the mild-type chronic FK506 nephropathy group, which included 7 episode biopsies, were statistically higher than those in the minimum-type chronic FK506-nephropathy group (P< 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that chronic FK506 nephropathy consists primarily of arteriolopathy manifesting as insudative hyalinosis of the arteriolar wall, and suggests that mild-type chronic FK506 nephropathy is a condition which may lead to deterioration of renal allograft function.";hepatorenal
Patterns of hepatic injury induced by methyldopa.;Twelve patients with liver disease related to methyldopa were seen between 1967 and 1977. Illness occurred within 1--9 weeks of commencement of therapy in 9 patients, the remaining 3 patients having received the drug for 13 months, 15 months and 7 years before experiencing symptoms. Jaundice with tender hepatomegaly, usually preceded by symptoms of malaise, anorexia, nausea and vomiting, and associated with upper abdominal pain, was an invariable finding in all patients. Biochemical liver function tests indicated hepatocellular necrosis and correlated with histopathological evidence of hepatic injury, the spectrum of which ranged from fatty change and focal hepatocellular necrosis to massive hepatic necrosis. Most patients showed moderate to severe acute hepatitis or chronic active hepatitis with associated cholestasis. The drug was withdrawn on presentation to hospital in 11 patients, with rapid clinical improvement in 9. One patient died, having presented in hepatic failure, and another, who had been taking methyldopa for 7 years, showed slower clinical and biochemical resolution over a period of several months. The remaining patient in the series developed fulminant hepatitis when the drug was accidentally recommenced 1 year after a prior episode of methyldopa-induced hepatitis. In this latter patient, and in 2 others, the causal relationship between methyldopa and hepatic dysfunction was proved with the recurrence of hepatitis within 2 weeks of re-exposure to the drug.;neurological|hepatorenal

Neuroprotective effects of melatonin upon the offspring cerebellar cortex in the rat model of BCNU-induced cortical dysplasia.;Cortical dysplasia is a malformation characterized by defects in proliferation, migration and maturation. This study was designed to evaluate the alterations in offspring rat cerebellum induced by maternal exposure to carmustine-[1,3-bis (2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosoure] (BCNU) and to investigate the effects of exogenous melatonin upon cerebellar BCNU-induced cortical dysplasia, using histological and biochemical analyses. Pregnant Wistar rats were assigned to five groups: intact-control, saline-control, melatonin-treated, BCNU-exposed and BCNU-exposed plus melatonin. Rats were exposed to BCNU on embryonic day 15 and melatonin was given until delivery. Immuno/histochemistry and electron microscopy were carried out on the offspring cerebellum, and levels of malondialdehyde and superoxide dismutase were determined. Histopathologically, typical findings were observed in the cerebella from the control groups, but the findings consistent with early embryonic development were noted in BCNU-exposed cortical dysplasia group. There was a marked increase in the number of TUNEL positive cells and nestin positive cells in BCNU-exposed group, but a decreased immunoreactivity to glial fibrillary acidic protein, synaptophysin and transforming growth factor beta1 was observed, indicating a delayed maturation, and melatonin significantly reversed these changes. Malondialdehyde level in BCNU-exposed group was higher than those in control groups and melatonin decreased malondialdehyde levels in BCNU group (P<0.01), while there were no significant differences in the superoxide dismutase levels between these groups. These data suggest that exposure of animals to BCNU during pregnancy leads to delayed maturation of offspring cerebellum and melatonin protects the cerebellum against the effects of BCNU.;neurological|hepatorenal

Bilateral subthalamic nucleus stimulation for Parkinson's disease.;"High frequency stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is known to ameliorate the signs and symptoms of advanced Parkinson's disease. AIM: We studied the effect of high frequency STN stimulation in 23 patients. METHOD: Twenty-three patients suffering from severe Parkinson's disease (Stages III-V on Hoehn and Yahr scale) and, particularly bradykinesia, rigidity, and levodopa-induced dyskinesias underwent bilateral implantation of electrodes in the STN. Preoperative and postoperative assessments of these patients at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months follow-up, in ""on"" and ""off"" drug conditions, was carried out using Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, Hoehn and Yahr staging, England activities of daily living score and video recordings. RESULTS: After one year of electrical stimulation of the STN, the patients' scores for activities of daily living and motor examination scores (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale parts II and III) off medication improved by 62% and 61% respectively (p<0.0005). The subscores for the akinesia, rigidity, tremor and gait also improved. (p<0.0005). The average levodopa dose decreased from 813 mg to 359 mg. The cognitive functions remained unchanged. Two patients developed device-related complications and two patients experienced abnormal weight gain. CONCLUSION: Bilateral subthalamic nucleus stimulation is an effective treatment for advanced Parkinson's disease. It reduces the severity of ""off"" phase symptoms, improves the axial symptoms and reduces levodopa requirements. The reduction in the levodopa dose is useful in controlling drug-induced dyskinesias.";neurological

Reversal by phenylephrine of the beneficial effects of intravenous nitroglycerin in patients with acute myocardial infarction.;Nitroglycerin has been shown to reduce ST-segment elevation during acute myocardial infarction, an effect potentiated in the dog by agents that reverse nitroglycerin-induced hypotension. Our study was designed to determine the effects of combined nitroglycerin and phenylephrine therapy. Ten patients with acute transmural myocardial infarctions received intravenous nitroglycerin, sufficient to reduce mean arterial pressure from 107 +/- 6 to 85 +/- 6 mm Hg (P less than 0.001), for 60 minutes. Left ventricular filling pressure decreased from 19 +/- 2 to 11 +/- 2 mm Hg (P less than 0.001). SigmaST, the sum of ST-segment elevations in 16 precordial leads, decreased (P less than 0.02) with intravenous nitroglycerin. Subsequent addition of phenylephrine infusion, sufficient to re-elevate mean arterial pressure to 106 +/- 4 mm Hg (P less than 0.001) for 30 minutes, increased left ventricular filling pressure to 17 +/- 2 mm Hg (P less than 0.05) and also significantly increased sigmaST (P less than 0.05). Our results suggest that addition of phenylephrine to nitroglycerin is not beneficial in the treatment of patients with acute myocardial infarction.;cardiovascular

Swallowing-induced atrial tachyarrhythmia triggered by salbutamol: case report and review of the literature.;"CASE: A 49-year-old patient experienced chest discomfort while swallowing. On electrocardiogram, episodes of atrial tachyarrhythmia were recorded immediately after swallowing; 24-hour Holter monitoring recorded several events. The arrhythmia resolved after therapy with atenolol, but recurred a year later. The patient noticed that before these episodes he had been using an inhalator of salbutamol. After stopping the beta-agonist, and after a week with the atenolol, the arrhythmia disappeared. DISCUSSION: Swallowing-induced atrial tachyarrhythmia (SIAT) is a rare phenomenon. Fewer than 50 cases of SIAT have been described in the literature. This article summarizes all the cases published, creating a comprehensive review of the current knowledge and approach to SIAT. It discusses demographics, clinical characteristics and types of arrhythmia, postulated mechanisms of SIAT, and different treatment possibilities such as medications, surgery, and radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA). CONCLUSION: Salbutamol is presented here as a possible trigger for SIAT. Although it is difficult to define causality in a case report, it is logical to think that a beta-agonist like salbutamol (known to induce tachycardia) may be the trigger of adrenergic reflexes originating in the esophagus while swallowing and that a beta-blocker such as atenolol (that blocks the adrenergic activity) may relieve it.";neurological|cardiovascular
Regulation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and apoptotic pathways by betaine attenuates isoproterenol-induced acute myocardial injury in rats.;The present study was designed to investigate the cardioprotective effects of betaine on acute myocardial ischemia induced experimentally in rats focusing on regulation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and apoptotic pathways as the potential mechanism underlying the drug effect. Male Sprague Dawley rats were treated with betaine (100, 200, and 400 mg/kg) orally for 40 days. Acute myocardial ischemic injury was induced in rats by subcutaneous injection of isoproterenol (85 mg/kg), for two consecutive days. Serum cardiac marker enzyme, histopathological variables and expression of protein levels were analyzed. Oral administration of betaine (200 and 400 mg/kg) significantly reduced the level of cardiac marker enzyme in the serum and prevented left ventricular remodeling. Western blot analysis showed that isoproterenol-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 was maintained or further enhanced by betaine treatment in myocardium. Furthermore, betaine (200 and 400 mg/kg) treatment increased the ventricular expression of Bcl-2 and reduced the level of Bax, therefore causing a significant increase in the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax. The protective role of betaine on myocardial damage was further confirmed by histopathological examination. In summary, our results showed that betaine pretreatment attenuated isoproterenol-induced acute myocardial ischemia via the regulation of STAT3 and apoptotic pathways.;cardiovascular

A selective dopamine D4 receptor antagonist, NRA0160: a preclinical neuropharmacological profile.;NRA0160, 5 - [2- ( 4- ( 3 - fluorobenzylidene) piperidin-1-yl) ethyl] - 4 -(4-fluorophenyl) thiazole-2-carboxamide, has a high affinity for human cloned dopamine D4.2, D4.4 and D4.7 receptors, with Ki values of 0.5, 0.9 and 2.7 nM, respectively. NRA0160 is over 20,000fold more potent at the dopamine D4.2 receptor compared with the human cloned dopamine D2L receptor. NRA0160 has negligible affinity for the human cloned dopamine D3 receptor (Ki=39 nM), rat serotonin (5-HT)2A receptors (Ki=180 nM) and rat alpha1 adrenoceptor (Ki=237 nM). NRA0160 and clozapine antagonized locomotor hyperactivity induced by methamphetamine (MAP) in mice. NRA0160 and clozapine antagonized MAP-induced stereotyped behavior in mice, although their effects did not exceed 50% inhibition, even at the highest dose given. NRA0160 and clozapine significantly induced catalepsy in rats, although their effects did not exceed 50% induction even at the highest dose given. NRA0160 and clozapine significantly reversed the disruption of prepulse inhibition (PPI) in rats produced by apomorphine. NRA0160 and clozapine significantly shortened the phencyclidine (PCP)-induced prolonged swimming latency in rats in a water maze task. These findings suggest that NRA0160 may have unique antipsychotic activities without the liability of motor side effects typical of classical antipsychotics.;neurological

Neuropsychiatric behaviors in the MPTP marmoset model of Parkinson's disease.;OBJECTIVES: Neuropsychiatric symptoms are increasingly recognised as a significant problem in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). These symptoms may be due to 'sensitisation' following repeated levodopa treatment or a direct effect of dopamine on the disease state. The levodopa-treated MPTP-lesioned marmoset was used as a model of neuropsychiatric symptoms in PD patients. Here we compare the time course of levodopa-induced motor fluctuations and neuropsychiatric-like behaviors to determine the relationship between duration of treatment and onset of symptoms. METHODS: Marmosets were administered 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (2.0 mg/kg s.c.) for five days, resulting in stable parkinsonism. Levodopa (15 mg/kg and benserazide, 3.75 mg/kg) p.o. b.i.d, was administered for 30 days. Animals were evaluated for parkinsonian disability, dyskinesia and on-time (motor fluctuations) and neuropsychiatric-like behaviors on Day 0 (prior to levodopa) and on Days 1, 7, 13, 27 and 30 of treatment using post hoc DVD analysis by a trained rater, blind to the treatment day. RESULTS: The neuropsychiatric-like behavior rating scale demonstrated high interrater reliability between three trained raters of differing professional backgrounds. As anticipated, animals exhibited a progressive increase in levodopa-induced motor fluctuations, dyskinesia and wearing-off, that correlated with the duration of levodopa therapy. In contrast, levodopa-induced neuropsychiatric-like behaviors were present on Day 1 of levodopa treatment and their severity did not correlate with duration of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that neuropsychiatric disorders in PD are more likely an interaction between levodopa and the disease state than a consequence of sensitisation to repeated dopaminergic therapy.;neurological
Fusion genes resulting from alternative chromosomal translocations are overexpressed by gene-specific mechanisms in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma.;"Chromosomal translocations identified in hematopoietic and solid tumors result in deregulated expression of protooncogenes or creation of chimeric proteins with tumorigenic potential . In the pediatric solid tumor alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma , a consistent t ( 2 ; 13 ) ( q35 ; q14 ) or variant t ( 1 ; 13 ) ( p36 ; q14 ) translocation generates PAX3-FKHR or PAX7-FKHR fusion proteins , respectively . In this report , we demonstrate that in addition to functional alterations these translocations are associated with fusion product overexpression . Furthermore , PAX3-FKHR and PAX7-FKHR overexpression occurs by distinct mechanisms . Transcription of PAX3-FKHR is increased relative to wild-type PAX3 by a copy number-independent process . In contrast , PAX7-FKHR overexpression results from fusion gene amplification . Thus , gene-specific mechanisms were selected to overexpress PAX3-FKHR and PAX7-FKHR in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma , presumably due to differences in regulation between the wild-type loci . We postulate that these overexpression mechanisms ensure a critical level of gene product for the oncogenic effects of these fusions . .";neurological|oncological
Uncoupling of hypomyelination and glial cell death by a mutation in the proteolipid protein gene.;"Proteolipid protein ( PLP ; M ( r ) 30 , 000 ) is a highly conserved major polytopic membrane protein in myelin but its cellular function remains obscure . Neurological mutant mice can often provide model systems for human genetic disorders . Mutations of the X-chromosome-linked PLP gene are lethal , identified first in the jimpy mouse and subsequently in patients with Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease . The unexplained phenotype of these mutations includes degeneration and premature cell death of oligodendrocytes with associated hypomyelination . Here we show that a new mouse mutant rumpshaker is defined by the amino-acid substitution Ile-to-Thr at residue 186 in a membrane-embedded domain of PLP . Surprisingly , rumpshaker mice , although myelin-deficient , have normal longevity and a full complement of morphologically normal oligodendrocytes . Hypomyelination can thus be genetically separated from the PLP-dependent oligodendrocyte degeneration . We suggest that PLP has a vital function in glial cell development , distinct from its later role in myelin assembly , and that this dichotomy of action may explain the clinical spectrum of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease . .";neurological

Risk factors and predictors of levodopa-induced dyskinesia among multiethnic Malaysians with Parkinson's disease.;Chronic pulsatile levodopa therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD) leads to the development of motor fluctuations and dyskinesia. We studied the prevalence and predictors of levodopa-induced dyskinesia among multiethnic Malaysian patients with PD. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study involving 95 patients with PD on uninterrupted levodopa therapy for at least 6 months. The instrument used was the UPDRS questionnaires. The predictors of dyskinesia were determined using multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The mean age was 65.6 + 8.5 years. The mean onset age was 58.5 + 9.8 years. The median disease duration was 6 (7) years. Dyskinesia was present in 44% (n = 42) with median levodopa therapy of 3 years. There were 64.3% Chinese, 31% Malays, and 3.7% Indians and other ethnic groups. Eighty-one percent of patients with dyskinesia had clinical fluctuations. Patients with dyskinesia had lower onset age ( p < 0.001), longer duration of levodopa therapy ( p < 0.001), longer disease duration ( p < 0.001), higher total daily levodopa dose ( p < 0.001), and higher total UPDRS scores ( p = 0.005) than patients without dyskinesia. The three significant predictors of dyskinesia were duration of levodopa therapy, onset age, and total daily levodopa dose. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of levodopa-induced dyskinesia in our patients was 44%. The most significant predictors were duration of levodopa therapy, total daily levodopa dose, and onset age.;neurological

ATM mutations and phenotypes in ataxia-telangiectasia families in the British Isles: expression of mutant ATM and the risk of leukemia, lymphoma, and breast cancer.;"We report the spectrum of 59 ATM mutations observed in ataxia-telangiectasia ( A-T ) patients in the British Isles . Of 51 ATM mutations identified in families native to the British Isles , 11 were founder mutations , and 2 of these 11 conferred a milder clinical phenotype with respect to both cerebellar degeneration and cellular features . We report , in two A-T families , an ATM mutation ( 7271T-- > G ) that may be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in both homozygotes and heterozygotes ( relative risk 12 . 7 ; P = . 0025 ) , although there is a less severe A-T phenotype in terms of the degree of cerebellar degeneration . This mutation ( 7271T-- > G ) also allows expression of full-length ATM protein at a level comparable with that in unaffected individuals . In addition , we have studied 18 A-T patients , in 15 families , who developed leukemia , lymphoma , preleukemic T-cell proliferation , or Hodgkin lymphoma , mostly in childhood . A wide variety of ATM mutation types , including missense mutations and in-frame deletions , were seen in these patients .

Pharmacology of ACC-9653 (phenytoin prodrug).;ACC-9653, the disodium phosphate ester of 3-hydroxymethyl-5,5-diphenylhydantoin, is a prodrug of phenytoin with advantageous physicochemical properties. ACC-9653 is rapidly converted enzymatically to phenytoin in vivo. ACC-9653 and phenytoin sodium have equivalent anticonvulsant activity against seizures induced by maximal electroshock (MES) in mice following i.p., oral, or i.v. administration. The ED50 doses were 16 mg/kg for i.v. ACC-9653 and 8 mg/kg for i.v. phenytoin sodium. ACC-9653 and phenytoin sodium have similar antiarrhythmic activity against ouabain-induced ventricular tachycardia in anesthetized dogs. The total doses of ACC-9653 or phenytoin sodium necessary to convert the arrhythmia to a normal sinus rhythm were 24 +/- 6 and 14 +/- 3 mg/kg, respectively. Only phenytoin sodium displayed in vitro antiarrhythmic activity against strophanthidin-induced arrhythmias in guinea pig right atria. In anesthetized dogs, a high dose of ACC-9653 (31 mg/kg) was infused over 15, 20, and 30 min and the responses were compared to an equimolar dose of phenytoin sodium (21 mg/kg). The ACC-9653 and phenytoin sodium treatments produced similar marked reductions in diastolic blood pressure and contractile force (LVdP/dt). The maximum effects of each treatment occurred at the time of maximum phenytoin sodium levels. Acute toxicity studies of ACC-9653 and phenytoin sodium were carried out in mice, rats, rabbits, and dogs by i.v., i.m., and i.p. routes of administration. The systemic toxic signs of both agents were similar and occurred at approximately equivalent doses. Importantly, the local irritation of ACC-9653 was markedly less than phenytoin sodium following i.m. administration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS);neurological|cardiovascular

Effects of deliberate hypotension induced by labetalol with isoflurane on neuropsychological function.;The effect of deliberate hypotension on brain function measured by neuropsychological tests was studied in 41 adult patients. Twenty-four patients were anaesthetized for middle-ear surgery with deliberate hypotension induced by labetalol with isoflurane (hypotensive group). Seventeen patients without hypotension served as a control group. The mean arterial pressure was 77 +/- 2 mmHg (10.3 +/- 0.3 kPa) before hypotension and 50 +/- 0 mmHg (6.7 +/- 0.0 kPa) during hypotension in the hypotensive group, and 86 +/- 2 mmHg (11.5 +/- 0.3 kPa) during anaesthesia in the control group. The following psychological tests were performed: four subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (similarities, digit span, vocabulary and digit symbol), Trail-Making tests A and B, Zung tests (self-rating anxiety scale and self-rating depression scale) and two-part memory test battery with immediate and delayed recall. The tests were performed preoperatively and 2 days postoperatively. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in any of the tests in the changes from preoperative value to postoperative value. The results indicate that hypotension induced by labetalol with isoflurane has no significant harmful effects on mental functions compared to normotensive anaesthesia.;neurological
Warfarin-induced artery calcification is accelerated by growth and vitamin D.;The present studies demonstrate that growth and vitamin D treatment enhance the extent of artery calcification in rats given sufficient doses of Warfarin to inhibit gamma-carboxylation of matrix Gla protein, a calcification inhibitor known to be expressed by smooth muscle cells and macrophages in the artery wall. The first series of experiments examined the influence of age and growth status on artery calcification in Warfarin-treated rats. Treatment for 2 weeks with Warfarin caused massive focal calcification of the artery media in 20-day-old rats and less extensive focal calcification in 42-day-old rats. In contrast, no artery calcification could be detected in 10-month-old adult rats even after 4 weeks of Warfarin treatment. To directly examine the importance of growth to Warfarin-induced artery calcification in animals of the same age, 20-day-old rats were fed for 2 weeks either an ad libitum diet or a 6-g/d restricted diet that maintains weight but prevents growth. Concurrent treatment of both dietary groups with Warfarin produced massive focal calcification of the artery media in the ad libitum-fed rats but no detectable artery calcification in the restricted-diet, growth-inhibited group. Although the explanation for the association between artery calcification and growth status cannot be determined from the present study, there was a relationship between higher serum phosphate and susceptibility to artery calcification, with 30% higher levels of serum phosphate in young, ad libitum-fed rats compared with either of the groups that was resistant to Warfarin-induced artery calcification, ie, the 10-month-old rats and the restricted-diet, growth-inhibited young rats. This observation suggests that increased susceptibility to Warfarin-induced artery calcification could be related to higher serum phosphate levels. The second set of experiments examined the possible synergy between vitamin D and Warfarin in artery calcification. High doses of vitamin D are known to cause calcification of the artery media in as little as 3 to 4 days. High doses of the vitamin K antagonist Warfarin are also known to cause calcification of the artery media, but at treatment times of 2 weeks or longer yet not at 1 week. In the current study, we investigated the synergy between these 2 treatments and found that concurrent Warfarin administration dramatically increased the extent of calcification in the media of vitamin D-treated rats at 3 and 4 days. There was a close parallel between the effect of vitamin D dose on artery calcification and the effect of vitamin D dose on the elevation of serum calcium, which suggests that vitamin D may induce artery calcification through its effect on serum calcium. Because Warfarin treatment had no effect on the elevation in serum calcium produced by vitamin D, the synergy between Warfarin and vitamin D is probably best explained by the hypothesis that Warfarin inhibits the activity of matrix Gla protein as a calcification inhibitor. High levels of matrix Gla protein are found at sites of artery calcification in rats treated with vitamin D plus Warfarin, and chemical analysis showed that the protein that accumulated was indeed not gamma-carboxylated. These observations indicate that although the gamma-carboxyglutamate residues of matrix Gla protein are apparently required for its function as a calcification inhibitor, they are not required for its accumulation at calcification sites.;cardiovascular
Chemokine CCL2 and its receptor CCR2 are increased in the hippocampus following pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus.;BACKGROUND: Neuroinflammation occurs after seizures and is implicated in epileptogenesis. CCR2 is a chemokine receptor for CCL2 and their interaction mediates monocyte infiltration in the neuroinflammatory cascade triggered in different brain pathologies. In this work CCR2 and CCL2 expression were examined following status epilepticus (SE) induced by pilocarpine injection. METHODS: SE was induced by pilocarpine injection. Control rats were injected with saline instead of pilocarpine. Five days after SE, CCR2 staining in neurons and glial cells was examined using imunohistochemical analyses. The number of CCR2 positive cells was determined using stereology probes in the hippocampus. CCL2 expression in the hippocampus was examined by molecular assay. RESULTS: Increased CCR2 was observed in the hippocampus after SE. Seizures also resulted in alterations to the cell types expressing CCR2. Increased numbers of neurons that expressed CCR2 was observed following SE. Microglial cells were more closely apposed to the CCR2-labeled cells in SE rats. In addition, rats that experienced SE exhibited CCR2-labeling in populations of hypertrophied astrocytes, especially in CA1 and dentate gyrus. These CCR2+ astroctytes were not observed in control rats. Examination of CCL2 expression showed that it was elevated in the hippocampus following SE. CONCLUSION: The data show that CCR2 and CCL2 are up-regulated in the hippocampus after pilocarpine-induced SE. Seizures also result in changes to CCR2 receptor expression in neurons and astrocytes. These changes might be involved in detrimental neuroplasticity and neuroinflammatory changes that occur following seizures.;neurological

Combination of bortezomib, thalidomide, and dexamethasone (VTD) as a consolidation therapy after autologous stem cell transplantation for symptomatic multiple myeloma in Japanese patients.;Consolidation therapy for patients with multiple myeloma (MM) has been widely adopted to improve treatment response following autologous stem cell transplantation. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed the safety and efficacy of combination regimen of bortezomib, thalidomide, and dexamethasone (VTD) as consolidation therapy in 24 Japanese patients with newly diagnosed MM. VTD consisted of bortezomib at a dose of 1.3 mg/m(2) and dexamethasone at a dose of 40 mg/day on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of a 35-day cycle, with daily oral thalidomide at a dose of 100 mg/day. Grade 3-4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were documented in four and three patients (17 and 13 %), respectively, but drug dose reduction due to cytopenia was not required in any case. Peripheral neuropathy was common (63 %), but severe grade 3-4 peripheral neuropathy was not observed. Very good partial response or better response (>VGPR) rates before and after consolidation therapy were 54 and 79 %, respectively. Patients had a significant probability of improving from <VGPR before consolidation therapy to >VGPR after consolidation therapy (p = 0.041). The VTD regimen may be safe and effective as a consolidation therapy in the treatment of MM in Japanese population.;neurological

Dose-effect and structure-function relationships in doxorubicin cardiomyopathy.;"The cardiomyopathy (CM) produced by the anticancer drug doxorubicin (DXR) (Adriamycin) provides a unique opportunity to analyze dose-effect and structure-function relationships during development of myocardial disease. We measured the degree of morphologic damage by ultrastructural examination of endomyocardial biopsy and the degree of performance abnormally by right heart catheterization in patients receiving DXR. Morphologic damage was variable but was proportional to the total cumulative DXR dose between 100 and 600 mg/m2. Performance abnormalities correlated weakly with dose, exhibited a curvilinear relationship, and had a ""threshold"" for expression. Catheterization abnormalities correlated well with morphologic damage (r = 0.57 to 0.78) in a subgroup of patients in whom exercise hemodynamics were measured, and this relationship also exhibited a curvilinear, threshold configuration. In DXR-CM myocardial damage is proportional to the degree of cytotoxic insult (DXR dose) while myocardial function is preserved until a critical dose or degree of damage is reached, after which myocardial performance deteriorates rapidly.";cardiovascular|oncological

G130V, a common FRDA point mutation, appears to have arisen from a common founder.;Friedreich ataxia ( FRDA ) is the most common inherited ataxia . About 98 % of mutant alleles have an expansion of a GAA trinucleotide repeat in intron 1 of the affected gene , FRDA . The other 2 % are point mutations .

Haplotype analysis was undertaken on the four families who have been described with this mutation . The results suggest a common founder for this mutation . Although marked differences in extragenic marker haplotypes were seen in one family , similar intragenic haplotyping suggests the same mutation founder for this family with the differences explicable by two recombination events . .;neurological
Interstrain variation in acute toxic response to caffeine among inbred mice.;"Acute toxic dosage-dependent behavioral effects of caffeine were compared in adult males from seven inbred mouse strains (A/J, BALB/cJ, CBA/J, C3H/HeJ, C57BL/6J, DBA/2J, SWR/J). C57BL/6J, chosen as a ""prototypic"" mouse strain, was used to determine behavioral responses to a broad range (5-500 mg/kg) of caffeine doses. Five phenotypic characteristics--locomotor activity, righting ability, clonic seizure induction, stress-induced lethality, death without external stress--were scored at various caffeine doses in drug-naive animals under empirically optimized, rigidly constant experimental conditions. Mice (n = 12 for each point) received single IP injections of a fixed volume/g body weight of physiological saline carrier with or without caffeine in doses ranging from 125-500 mg/kg. Loss of righting ability was scored at 1, 3, 5 min post dosing and at 5 min intervals thereafter for 20 min. In the same animals the occurrence of clonic seizures was scored as to time of onset and severity for 20 min after drug administration. When these proceeded to tonic seizures, death occurred in less than 20 min. Animals surviving for 20 min were immediately stressed by a swim test in 25 degrees C water, and death-producing tonic seizures were scored for 2 min. In other animals locomotor activity was measured 15 or 60 min after caffeine administration. By any single behavioral criterion or a combination of these criteria, marked differences in response to toxic caffeine doses were observed between strains. These results indicate that behavioral toxicity testing of alkylxanthines in a single mouse strain may be misleading and suggest that toxic responses of the central nervous system to this class of compounds are genetically influenced in mammals.";neurological
Acute renal failure associated with prolonged intake of slimming pills containing anthraquinones.;Chinese herbal medicine preparations are widely available and often regarded by the public as natural and safe remedies for a variety of medical conditions. Nephropathy caused by Chinese herbs has previously been reported, usually involving the use of aristolochic acids. We report a 23-year-old woman who developed acute renal failure following prolonged use of a proprietary Chinese herbal slimming pill that contained anthraquinone derivatives, extracted from Rhizoma Rhei (rhubarb). The renal injury was probably aggravated by the concomitant intake of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, diclofenac. Renal pathology was that of hypocellular interstitial fibrosis. Spontaneous renal recovery occurred upon cessation of the slimming pills, but mild interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy was still evident histologically 4 months later. Although a causal relationship between the use of an anthraquinone-containing herbal agent and renal injury remains to be proven, phytotherapy-associated interstitial nephropathy should be considered in patients who present with unexplained renal failure.;hepatorenal
The protective role of Nrf2 in streptozotocin-induced diabetic nephropathy.;OBJECTIVE: Diabetic nephropathy is one of the major causes of renal failure, which is accompanied by the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Nrf2 is the primary transcription factor that controls the antioxidant response essential for maintaining cellular redox homeostasis. Here, we report our findings demonstrating a protective role of Nrf2 against diabetic nephropathy. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We explore the protective role of Nrf2 against diabetic nephropathy using human kidney biopsy tissues from diabetic nephropathy patients, a streptozotocin-induced diabetic nephropathy model in Nrf2(-/-) mice, and cultured human mesangial cells. RESULTS: The glomeruli of human diabetic nephropathy patients were under oxidative stress and had elevated Nrf2 levels. In the animal study, Nrf2 was demonstrated to be crucial in ameliorating streptozotocin-induced renal damage. This is evident by Nrf2(-/-) mice having higher ROS production and suffering from greater oxidative DNA damage and renal injury compared with Nrf2(+/+) mice. Mechanistic studies in both in vivo and in vitro systems showed that the Nrf2-mediated protection against diabetic nephropathy is, at least, partially through inhibition of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) and reduction of extracellular matrix production. In human renal mesangial cells, high glucose induced ROS production and activated expression of Nrf2 and its downstream genes. Furthermore, activation or overexpression of Nrf2 inhibited the promoter activity of TGF-beta1 in a dose-dependent manner, whereas knockdown of Nrf2 by siRNA enhanced TGF-beta1 transcription and fibronectin production. CONCLUSIONS: This work clearly indicates a protective role of Nrf2 in diabetic nephropathy, suggesting that dietary or therapeutic activation of Nrf2 could be used as a strategy to prevent or slow down the progression of diabetic nephropathy.;neurological|hepatorenal
GLEPP1 receptor tyrosine phosphatase (Ptpro) in rat PAN nephrosis. A marker of acute podocyte injury.;Glomerular epithelial protein 1 (GLEPP1) is a podocyte receptor membrane protein tyrosine phosphatase located on the apical cell membrane of visceral glomerular epithelial cell and foot processes. This receptor plays a role in regulating the structure and function of podocyte foot process. To better understand the utility of GLEPP1 as a marker of glomerular injury, the amount and distribution of GLEPP1 protein and mRNA were examined by immunohistochemistry, Western blot and RNase protection assay in a model of podocyte injury in the rat. Puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis was induced by single intraperitoneal injection of puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN, 20 mg/100g BW). Tissues were analyzed at 0, 5, 7, 11, 21, 45, 80 and 126 days after PAN injection so as to include both the acute phase of proteinuria associated with foot process effacement (days 5-11) and the chronic phase of proteinuria associated with glomerulosclerosis (days 45-126). At day 5, GLEPP1 protein and mRNA were reduced from the normal range (265.2 +/- 79.6 x 10(6) moles/glomerulus and 100%) to 15% of normal (41.8 +/- 4.8 x 10(6) moles/glomerulus, p < 0.005). This occurred in association with an increase in urinary protein content from 1.8 +/- 1 to 99.0 +/- 61 mg/day (p < 0.001). In contrast, podocalyxin did not change significantly at this time. By day 11, GLEPP1 protein and mRNA had begun to return towards baseline. By day 45-126, at a time when glomerular scarring was present, GLEPP1 was absent from glomerulosclerotic areas although the total glomerular content of GLEPP1 was not different from normal. We conclude that GLEPP1 expression, unlike podocalyxin, reflects podocyte injury induced by PAN. GLEPP1 expression may be a useful marker of podocyte injury.;hepatorenal
Transgenic mice carrying large human genomic sequences with expanded CTG repeat mimic closely the DM CTG repeat intergenerational and somatic instability.;Myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) is caused by a CTG repeat expansion in the 3UTR of the DM protein kinase ( DMPK ) gene . A very high level of instability is observed through successive generations and the size of the repeat is generally correlated with the severity of the disease and with age at onset . Furthermore , tissues from DM patients exhibit somatic mosaicism that increases with age . We generated transgenic mice carrying large human genomic sequences with 20 , 55 or > 300 CTG , cloned from patients from the same affected DM family . Using large human flanking sequences and a large amplification , we demonstrate that the intergenerational CTG repeat instability is reproduced in mice , with a strong bias towards expansions and with the same sex- and size-dependent characteristics as in humans . Moreover , a high level of instability , increasing with age , can be observed in tissues and in sperm . Although we did not observe dramatic expansions ( or big jumps over several hundred CTG repeats ) as in congenital forms of DM , our model carrying > 300 CTG is the first to show instability so close to the human DM situation . Our three models carrying different sizes of CTG repeat provide insight on the different factors modulating the CTG repeat instability . .;neurological

The role of nicotine in smoking-related cardiovascular disease.;Nicotine activates the sympathetic nervous system and in this way could contribute to cardiovascular disease. Animal studies and mechanistic studies indicate that nicotine could play a role in accelerating atherosclerosis, but evidence among humans is too inadequate to be definitive about such an effect. Almost certainly, nicotine via its hemodynamic effects contributes to acute cardiovascular events, although current evidence suggests that the effects of nicotine are much less important than are the prothrombotic effects of cigarette smoking or the effects of carbon monoxide. Nicotine does not appear to enhance thrombosis among humans. Clinical studies of pipe smokers and people using transdermal nicotine support the idea that toxins other than nicotine are the most important causes of acute cardiovascular events. Finally, the dose response for cardiovascular events of nicotine appears to be flat, suggesting that if nicotine is involved, adverse effects might be seen with relatively low-level cigarette exposures.;cardiovascular

Dexmedetomidine, acting through central alpha-2 adrenoceptors, prevents opiate-induced muscle rigidity in the rat.;"The highly-selective alpha-2 adrenergic agonist dexmedetomidine (D-MED) is capable of inducing muscle flaccidity and anesthesia in rats and dogs. Intense generalized muscle rigidity is an undesirable side effect of potent opiate agonists. Although the neurochemistry of opiate-induced rigidity has yet to be fully elucidated, recent work suggests a role for a central adrenergic mechanism. In the present study, the authors determined if treatment with D-MED prevents the muscle rigidity caused by high-dose alfentanil anesthesia in the rat. Animals (n = 42) were treated intraperitoneally with one of the following six regimens: 1) L-MED (the inactive L-isomer of medetomidine), 30 micrograms/kg; 2) D-MED, 10 micrograms/kg; 3) D-MED, 30 micrograms/kg; 4) D-MED [30 micrograms/kg] and the central-acting alpha-2 antagonist, idazoxan [10 mg/kg]; 5) D-MED [30 micrograms/kg] and the peripheral-acting alpha-2 antagonist DG-5128 [10 mg/kg], or; 6) saline. Baseline electromyographic activity was recorded from the gastrocnemius muscle before and after drug treatment. Each rat was then injected with alfentanil (ALF, 0.5 mg/kg sc). ALF injection resulted in a marked increase in hindlimb EMG activity in the L-MED treatment group which was indistinguishable from that seen in animals treated with saline. In contrast, D-MED prevented alfentanil-induced muscle rigidity in a dose-dependent fashion. The small EMG values obtained in the high-dose D-MED group were comparable with those recorded in earlier studies from control animals not given any opiate. The high-dose D-MED animals were flaccid, akinetic, and lacked a startle response during the entire experimental period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)";neurological
Subjective assessment of sexual dysfunction of patients on long-term administration of digoxin.;Various data suggest that male patients who have received digoxin on a longterm basis have increased levels of serum estrogen and decreased levels of plasma testosterone and luteinizing hormone (LH). This study was undertaken to investigate the links between the long-term administration of digoxin therapy and sexual behavior, and the effect of digoxin on plasma levels of estradiol, testosterone, and LH. The patients of the study and control group (without digoxin) were of similar cardiac functional capacity and age (25-40 years) and were randomly selected from the rheumatic heart disease patients. A subjective assessment of sexual behavior in the study and control groups was carried out, using parameters such as sexual desire, sexual excitement, and frequency of sexual relations. Personal interviews and a questionnaire were also used for the evaluation of sexual behavior. The findings support the reports concerning digoxin effect on plasma estradiol, testosterone, and LH. The differences in the means were significant. Tests used to evaluate the changes in sexual behavior showed a significant decrease in sexual desire, sexual excitement phase (erection), and frequency of sexual relations in the study group.;cardiovascular

Cardiovascular risk with cyclooxygenase inhibitors: general problem with substance specific differences?;Randomised clinical trials and observational studies have shown an increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, hypertension and heart failure during treatment with cyclooxygenase inhibitors. Adverse cardiovascular effects occurred mainly, but not exclusively, in patients with concomitant risk factors. Cyclooxygenase inhibitors cause complex changes in renal, vascular and cardiac prostanoid profiles thereby increasing vascular resistance and fluid retention. The incidence of cardiovascular adverse events tends to increase with the daily dose and total exposure time. A comparison of individual selective and unselective cyclooxygenase inhibitors suggests substance-specific differences, which may depend on differences in pharmacokinetic parameters or inhibitory potency and may be contributed by prostaglandin-independent effects. Diagnostic markers such as N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) or high-sensitive C-reactive protein might help in the early identification of patients at risk, thus avoiding the occurrence of serious cardiovascular toxicity.;neurological|cardiovascular|hepatorenal

Calcineurin-inhibitor induced pain syndrome (CIPS): a severe disabling complication after organ transplantation.;Bone pain after transplantation is a frequent complication that can be caused by several diseases. Treatment strategies depend on the correct diagnosis of the pain. Nine patients with severe pain in their feet, which was registered after transplantation, were investigated. Bone scans showed an increased tracer uptake of the foot bones. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated bone marrow oedema in the painful bones. Pain was not explained by other diseases causing foot pain, like reflex sympathetic dystrophy, polyneuropathy, Morton's neuralgia, gout, osteoporosis, avascular necrosis, intermittent claudication, orthopaedic foot deformities, stress fractures, and hyperparathyroidism. The reduction of cyclosporine- or tacrolimus trough levels and the administration of calcium channel blockers led to relief of pain. The Calcineurin-inhibitor Induced Pain Syndrome (CIPS) is a rare but severe side effect of cyclosporine or tacrolimus and is accurately diagnosed by its typical presentation, magnetic resonance imaging and bone scans. Incorrect diagnosis of the syndrome will lead to a significant reduction of life quality in patients suffering from CIPS.;neurological

Further mapping of an ataxia-telangiectasia locus to the chromosome 11q23 region.;We recently mapped the gene for ataxia-telangiectasia group A ( ATA ) to chromosome 11q22-23 by linkage analysis , using the genetic markers THY1 and pYNB3 . 12 ( D11S144 ) . The most likely order was cent-AT-S144-THY1 . The present paper describes further mapping of the AT locus by means of a panel of 10 markers that span approximately 60 cM in the 11q22-23 region centered around S144 and THY1 . Location scores indicate that three contiguous subsegments within the [ S144-THY1 ] segment , as well as three contiguous segments telomeric to THY1 , are each unlikely to contain the AT locus , while the more centromeric [ STMY-S144 ] segment is most likely to contain the AT locus . These data , together with recent refinements in the linkage and physical maps of 11q22-23 , place the AT locus at 11q23 .;neurological
Cauda equina syndrome after epidural steroid injection: a case report.;OBJECTIVE: Conventional treatment methods of lumbusacral radiculopathy are physical therapy, epidural steroid injections, oral medications, and spinal manipulative therapy. Cauda equina syndrome is a rare complication of epidural anesthesia. The following case is a report of cauda equina syndrome possibly caused by epidural injection of triamcinolone and bupivacaine. CLINICAL FEATURES: A 50-year-old woman with low back and right leg pain was scheduled for epidural steroid injection. INTERVENTION AND OUTCOME: An 18-gauge Touhy needle was inserted until loss of resistance occurred at the L4-5 level. Spread of the contrast medium within the epidural space was determined by radiographic imaging. After verifying the epidural space, bupivacaine and triamcinolone diacetate were injected. After the injection, there was a reduction in radicular symptoms. Three hours later, she complained of perineal numbness and lower extremity weakness. The neurologic evaluation revealed loss of sensation in the saddle area and medial aspect of her right leg. There was a decrease in the perception of pinprick test. Deep-tendon reflexes were decreased especially in the right leg. She was unable to urinate. The patient's symptoms improved slightly over the next few hours. She had a gradual return of motor function and ability of feeling Foley catheter. All of the symptoms were completely resolved over the next 8 hours. CONCLUSION: Complications associated with epidural steroid injections are rare. Clinical examination and continued vigilance for neurologic deterioration after epidural steroid injections is important.;neurological
Development of proteinuria after switch to sirolimus-based immunosuppression in long-term cardiac transplant patients.;"Calcineurin-inhibitor therapy can lead to renal dysfunction in heart transplantation patients. The novel immunosuppressive (IS) drug sirolmus (Srl) lacks nephrotoxic effects; however, proteinuria associated with Srl has been reported following renal transplantation. In cardiac transplantation, the incidence of proteinuria associated with Srl is unknown. In this study, long-term cardiac transplant patients were switched from cyclosporine to Srl-based IS. Concomitant IS consisted of mycophenolate mofetil +/- steroids. Proteinuria increased significantly from a median of 0.13 g/day (range 0-5.7) preswitch to 0.23 g/day (0-9.88) at 24 months postswitch (p = 0.0024). Before the switch, 11.5% of patients had high-grade proteinuria (>1.0 g/day); this increased to 22.9% postswitch (p = 0.006). ACE inhibitor and angiotensin-releasing blocker (ARB) therapy reduced proteinuria development. Patients without proteinuria had increased renal function (median 42.5 vs. 64.1, p = 0.25), whereas patients who developed high-grade proteinuria showed decreased renal function at the end of follow-up (median 39.6 vs. 29.2, p = 0.125). Thus, proteinuria may develop in cardiac transplant patients after switch to Srl, which may have an adverse effect on renal function in these patients. Srl should be used with ACEi/ARB therapy and patients monitored for proteinuria and increased renal dysfunction.";cardiovascular|hepatorenal
Phenytoin encephalopathy as probable idiosyncratic reaction: case report.;A case of phenytoin (DPH) encephalopathy with increasing seizures and EEG and mental changes is described. Despite adequate oral dosage of DPH (5 mg/kg/daily) the plasma level was very low (2.8 microgramg/ml). The encephalopathy was probably an idiosyncratic and not toxic or allergic reaction. In fact the concentration of free DPH was normal, the patient presented a retarded morbilliform rash during DPH treatment, the protidogram was normal, and an intradermic DPH injection had no local effect. The authors conclude that in a patient starting DPH treatment an unexpected increase in seizures, with EEG and mental changes occurring simultaneously, should alert the physician to the possible need for eliminating DPH from the therapeutic regimen, even if plasma concentrations are low.;neurological

The long-term safety of danazol in women with hereditary angioedema.;Although the short-term safety (less than or equal to 6 months) of danazol has been established in a variety of settings, no information exists as to its long-term safety. We therefore investigated the long-term safety of danazol by performing a retrospective chart review of 60 female patients with hereditary angioedema treated with danazol for a continuous period of 6 months or longer. The mean age of the patients was 35.2 years and the mean duration of therapy was 59.7 months. Virtually all patients experienced one or more adverse reactions. Menstrual abnormalities (79%), weight gain (60%), muscle cramps/myalgias (40%), and transaminase elevations (40%) were the most common adverse reactions. The drug was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 8 patients. No patient has died or suffered any apparent long-term sequelae that were directly attributable to the drug. We conclude that, despite a relatively high incidence of adverse reactions, danazol has proven to be remarkably safe over the long-term in this group of patients.;hepatorenal

Efficacy and proarrhythmia with the use of d,l-sotalol for sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias.;"This study prospectively evaluated the clinical efficacy, the incidence of torsades de pointes, and the presumable risk factors for torsades de pointes in patients treated with d,l-sotalol for sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Eighty-one consecutive patients (54 with coronary artery disease, and 20 with dilated cardiomyopathy) with inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation received oral d,l-sotalol to prevent induction of the ventricular tachyarrhythmia. During oral loading with d,l-sotalol, continuous electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring was performed. Those patients in whom d,l-sotalol prevented induction of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation were discharged with the drug and followed up on an outpatient basis for 21 +/- 18 months. Induction of the ventricular tachyarrhythmia was prevented by oral d,l-sotalol in 35 (43%) patients; the ventricular tachyarrhythmia remained inducible in 40 (49%) patients; and two (2.5%) patients did not tolerate even 40 mg of d,l-sotalol once daily. Four (5%) patients had from torsades de pointes during the initial oral treatment with d,l-sotalol. Neither ECG [sinus-cycle length (SCL), QT or QTc interval, or U wave] nor clinical parameters identified patients at risk for torsades de pointes. However, the oral dose of d,l-sotalol was significantly lower in patients with torsades de pointes (200 +/- 46 vs. 328 +/- 53 mg/day; p = 0.0017). Risk factors associated with the development of torsades de pointes were the appearance of an U wave (p = 0.049), female gender (p = 0.015), and significant dose-corrected changes of SCL, QT interval, and QTc interval (p < 0.05). During follow-up, seven (20%) patients had a nonfatal ventricular tachycardia recurrence, and two (6%) patients died suddenly. One female patient with stable cardiac disease had recurrent torsades de pointes after 2 years of successful treatment with d,l-sotalol. Torsades de pointes occurred early during treatment even with low doses of oral d,l-sotalol. Pronounced changes in the surface ECG (cycle length, QT, and QTc) in relation to the dose of oral d,l-sotalol might identify a subgroup of patients with an increased risk for torsades de pointes. Other ECG parameters before the application of d,l-sotalol did not identify patients at increased risk for torsades de pointes. Recurrence rates of ventricular tachyarrhythmias are high despite complete suppression of the arrhythmia during programmed stimulation. Therefore programmed electrical stimulation in the case of d,l-sotalol seems to be of limited prognostic value.";neurological|cardiovascular

Heterozygous loss of Six5 in mice is sufficient to cause ocular cataracts.;"Myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by skeletal muscle wasting , myotonia , cardiac arrhythmia , hyperinsulinaemia , mental retardation and ocular cataracts . The genetic defect in DM is a CTG repeat expansion located in the 3 untranslated region of DMPK and 5 of a homeodomain-encoding gene , SIX5 ( formerly DMAHP ; refs 2-5 ) . There are three mechanisms by which CTG expansion can result in DM . First , repeat expansion may alter the processing or transport of the mutant DMPK mRNA and consequently reduce DMPK levels . Second , CTG expansion may establish a region of heterochromatin 3 of the repeat sequence and decrease SIX5 transcription . Third , toxic effects of the repeat expansion may be intrinsic to the repeated elements at the level of DNA or RNA ( refs 10 , 11 ) . Previous studies have demonstrated that a dose-dependent loss of Dm15 ( the mouse DMPK homologue ) in mice produces a partial DM phenotype characterized by decreased development of skeletal muscle force and cardiac conduction disorders . To test the role of Six5 loss in DM , we have analysed a strain of mice in which Six5 was deleted . Our results demonstrate that the rate and severity of cataract formation is inversely related to Six5 dosage and is temporally progressive . Six5 + / - and Six5- / - mice show increased steady-state levels of the Na + / K + -ATPase alpha-1 subunit and decreased Dm15 mRNA levels . Thus , altered ion homeostasis within the lens may contribute to cataract formation . As ocular cataracts are a characteristic feature of DM , these results demonstrate that decreased SIX5 transcription is important in the aetiology of DM . Our data support the hypothesis that DM is a contiguous gene syndrome associated with the partial loss of both DMPK and SIX5 . .";neurological|cardiovascular

Prolonged paralysis due to nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents and corticosteroids.;The long-term use of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents (ND-NMBA) has recently been implicated as a cause of prolonged muscle weakness, although the site of the lesion and the predisposing factors have been unclear. We report 3 patients (age 37-52 years) with acute respiratory insufficiency who developed prolonged weakness following the discontinuation of ND-NMBAs. Two patients also received intravenous corticosteroids. Renal function was normal but hepatic function was impaired in all patients, and all had acidosis. Electrophysiologic studies revealed low amplitude compound motor action potentials, normal sensory studies, and fibrillations. Repetitive stimulation at 2 Hz showed a decremental response in 2 patients. The serum vecuronium level measured in 1 patient 14 days after the drug had been discontinued was 172 ng/mL. A muscle biopsy in this patient showed loss of thick, myosin filaments. The weakness in these patients is due to pathology at both the neuromuscular junction (most likely due to ND-NMBA) and muscle (most likely due to corticosteroids). Hepatic dysfunction and acidosis are contributing risk factors.;neurological|hepatorenal
Adult onset globoid cell leukodystrophy (Krabbe disease): analysis of galactosylceramidase cDNA from four Japanese patients.;"We examined galactosylceramidase ( GALC ) cDNA in four Japanese patients with adult onset globoid cell leukodystrophy ( Krabbe disease ; AO-GLD ) by polymerase chain reaction / single-strand conformation polymorphism ( PCR-SSCP ) analysis , subsequent sequence determination , and restriction enzyme digestion of PCR products , initial symptoms were the onset of slowly progressive spastic paraplegia from the middle of the second decade , and all patients had diminished GALC activity in their leukocytes . We identified three missense mutations ( I66M , G270D , L618S ) and one exon-6 skipping ( 535-573del ) . Two of the patients had only the I66M mutant mRNA , and one only the G27OD mutant mRNA . The fourth patient carried a compound heterozygous mutation of 535-573del and L618S . To determine the enzymatic activities produced by these mutations , we constructed mutated GALC cDNAs and expressed them in COS-1 cells . Three mutations , viz . , G270D , L618S , and exon-6 skipping ( 535-573del ) , produced diminished GALC activity as expected . The I66M mutation in the wild-type GALC cDNA ( I289 ) had normal activity , but when this mutation and the V289 polymorphism were introduced into the same allele , it had decreased activity . Thus , the combination of a unique mutation and polymorphism causes conformational change in the GALC enzyme , resulting in low enzymatic activity . AO-GLD mutations , including those found here , are located in the N-terminus ( I66M , G270D , 535-573del ) or C-terminus ( L618S ) of the GALC enzyme , whereas the reported mutations in the infantile form ( IF-GLD ) are in the central domain . This difference in mutation sites may affect the clinical features of GLD .";neurological

P53 inhibition exacerbates late-stage anthracycline cardiotoxicity.;AIMS: Doxorubicin (DOX) is an effective anti-cancer therapeutic, but is associated with both acute and late-stage cardiotoxicity. Children are particularly sensitive to DOX-induced heart failure. Here, the impact of p53 inhibition on acute vs. late-stage DOX cardiotoxicity was examined in a juvenile model. METHODS AND RESULTS: Two-week-old MHC-CB7 mice (which express dominant-interfering p53 in cardiomyocytes) and their non-transgenic (NON-TXG) littermates received weekly DOX injections for 5 weeks (25 mg/kg cumulative dose). One week after the last DOX treatment (acute stage), MHC-CB7 mice exhibited improved cardiac function and lower levels of cardiomyocyte apoptosis when compared with the NON-TXG mice. Surprisingly, by 13 weeks following the last DOX treatment (late stage), MHC-CB7 exhibited a progressive decrease in cardiac function and higher rates of cardiomyocyte apoptosis when compared with NON-TXG mice. p53 inhibition blocked transient DOX-induced STAT3 activation in MHC-CB7 mice, which was associated with enhanced induction of the DNA repair proteins Ku70 and Ku80. Mice with cardiomyocyte-restricted deletion of STAT3 exhibited worse cardiac function, higher levels of cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and a greater induction of Ku70 and Ku80 in response to DOX treatment during the acute stage when compared with control animals. CONCLUSION: These data support a model wherein a p53-dependent cardioprotective pathway, mediated via STAT3 activation, mitigates DOX-induced myocardial stress during drug delivery. Furthermore, these data suggest an explanation as to how p53 inhibition can result in cardioprotection during drug treatment and, paradoxically, enhanced cardiotoxicity long after the cessation of drug treatment.;neurological|cardiovascular|hepatorenal|oncological

Fear-potentiated startle, but not light-enhanced startle, is enhanced by anxiogenic drugs.;RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The light-enhanced startle paradigm (LES) is suggested to model anxiety, because of the non-specific cue and the long-term effect. In contrast, the fear-potentiated startle (FPS) is suggested to model conditioned fear. However, the pharmacological profiles of these two paradigms are very similar. The present study investigated the effects of putative anxiogenic drugs on LES and FPS and aimed at determining the sensitivity of LES for anxiogenic drugs and to potentially showing a pharmacological differentiation between these two paradigms. METHODS: Male Wistar rats received each dose of the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine (0.25-1.0mg/kg), the 5-HT(2C) receptor agonist m-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP, 0.5-2.0mg/kg) or the GABA(A) inverse receptor agonist pentylenetetrazole (PTZ, 3-30mg/kg) and were subsequently tested in either LES or FPS. RESULTS: None of the drugs enhanced LES, whereas mCPP increased percentage FPS and yohimbine increased absolute FPS values. Furthermore, yohimbine increased baseline startle amplitude in the LES, while mCPP suppressed baseline startle in both the LES and FPS and PTZ suppressed baseline startle in the FPS. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to findings in the FPS paradigm, none of the drugs were able to exacerbate the LES response. Thus, a clear pharmacological differentiation was found between LES and FPS.;neurological

Three other peroxisomal ABC transporters currently are known  adrenoleukodystrophy-related protein ( ALDRP ) , 70 kDa peroxisomal membrane protein ( PMP70 ) and PMP70- related protein . By using transient and stable overexpression of human cDNAs encoding ALDP and its closest relative ALDRP , we could restore the impaired peroxisomal beta-oxidation in fibroblasts of X-ALD patients . The pathognomonic accumulation of very long chain fatty acids could also be prevented by overexpression of ALDRP in immortalized X-ALD cells . Immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that the functional replacement of ALDP by ALDRP was not due to stabilization of the mutated ALDP itself . Moreover , we were able to restore the peroxisomal beta-oxidation defect in the liver of ALDP-deficient mice by stimulation of ALDRP and PMP70 gene expression through a dietary treatment with the peroxisome proliferator fenofibrate . These results suggest that a correction of the biochemical defect in X-ALD could be possible by drug-induced overexpression or ectopic expression of ALDRP . .;neurological|hepatorenal
Valsartan, a new angiotensin II antagonist for the treatment of essential hypertension: a comparative study of the efficacy and safety against amlodipine.;"OBJECTIVE: To compare the antihypertensive efficacy of a new angiotensin II antagonist, valsartan, with a reference therapy, amlodipine. METHODS: One hundred sixty-eight adult outpatients with mild to moderate hypertension were randomly allocated in double-blind fashion and equal number to receive 80 mg valsartan or 5 mg amlodipine for 12 weeks. After 8 weeks of therapy, in patients whose blood pressure remained uncontrolled, 5 mg amlodipine was added to the initial therapy. Patients were assessed at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. The primary efficacy variable was change from baseline in mean sitting diastolic blood pressure at 8 weeks. Secondary variables included change in sitting systolic blood pressure and responder rates. RESULTS: Both valsartan and amlodipine were effective at lowering blood pressure at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. Similar decreases were observed in both groups, with no statistically significant differences between the groups for any variable analyzed. For the primary variable the difference was 0.5 mm Hg in favor of valsartan (p = 0.68; 95% confidence interval, -2.7 to 1.7). Responder rates at 8 weeks were 66.7% for valsartan and 60.2% for amlodipine (p = 0.39). Both treatments were well tolerated. The incidence of drug-related dependent edema was somewhat higher in the amlodipine group, particularly at a dose of 10 mg per day (2.4% for 80 mg valsartan; 3.6% for 5 mg amlodipine; 0% for valsartan plus 5 mg amlodipine; 14.3% for 10 mg amlodipine). CONCLUSIONS: The data show that valsartan is at least as effective as amlodipine in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension. The results also show valsartan to be well tolerated and suggest that it is not associated with side effects characteristic of this comparator class, dihydropyridine calcium antagonists.";cardiovascular

Efficacy and safety of asenapine in a placebo- and haloperidol-controlled trial in patients with acute exacerbation of schizophrenia.;"Asenapine is approved by the Food and Drugs Administration in adults for acute treatment of schizophrenia or of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder with or without psychotic features. In a double-blind 6-week trial, 458 patients with acute schizophrenia were randomly assigned to fixed-dose treatment with asenapine at 5 mg twice daily (BID), asenapine at 10 mg BID, placebo, or haloperidol at 4 mg BID (to verify assay sensitivity). With last observations carried forward (LOCF), mean Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total score reductions from baseline to endpoint were significantly greater with asenapine at 5 mg BID (-16.2) and haloperidol (-15.4) than placebo (-10.7; both P < 0.05); using mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM), changes at day 42 were significantly greater with asenapine at 5 and 10 mg BID (-21.3 and -19.4, respectively) and haloperidol (-20.0) than placebo (-14.6; all P < 0.05). On the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale positive subscale, all treatments were superior to placebo with LOCF and MMRM; asenapine at 5 mg BID was superior to placebo on the negative subscale with MMRM and on the general psychopathology subscale with LOCF and MMRM. Treatment-related adverse events (AEs) occurred in 44% and 52%, 57%, and 41% of the asenapine at 5 and 10 mg BID, haloperidol, and placebo groups, respectively. Extrapyramidal symptoms reported as AEs occurred in 15% and 18%, 34%, and 10% of the asenapine at 5 and 10 mg BID, haloperidol, and placebo groups, respectively. Across all groups, no more than 5% of patients had clinically significant weight change. Post hoc analyses indicated that efficacy was similar with asenapine and haloperidol; greater contrasts were seen in AEs, especially extrapyramidal symptoms.";neurological

Clinically significant proteinuria following the administration of sirolimus to renal transplant recipients.;BACKGROUND: Sirolimus is the latest immunosuppressive agent used to prevent rejection, and may have less nephrotoxicity than calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)-based regimens. To date there has been little documentation of clinically significant proteinuria linked with the use of sirolimus. We have encountered several patients who developed substantial proteinuria associated with sirolimus use. In each patient, the close temporal association between the commencement of sirolimus therapy and proteinuria implicated sirolimus as the most likely etiology of the proteinuria. METHODS: We analyzed the clinical and laboratory information available for all 119 patients transplanted at the Washington Hospital Center between 1999-2003 for whom sirolimus was a component of their immunosuppressant regimen. In these patients, the magnitude of proteinuria was assessed on morning urine samples by turbidometric measurement or random urine protein:creatinine ratios, an estimate of grams of proteinuria/day. Laboratory results were compared between prior, during and following sirolimus use. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients (24%) developed increased proteinuria from baseline during their post-transplantation course. In 21 patients an alternative cause of proteinuria was either obvious or insufficient data was available to be conclusive. In 7 of the 28 patients there was a striking temporal association between the initiation of sirolimus and the development of nephrotic-range proteinuria. Proteinuria correlated most strongly with sirolimus therapy when compared to other demographic and clinical variables. In most patients, discontinuation of sirolimus resulted in a decrease, but not resolution, of proteinuria. CONCLUSIONS: Sirolimus induces or aggravates pre-existing proteinuria in an unpredictable subset of renal allograft recipients. Proteinuria may improve, but does not resolve, when sirolimus is withdrawn.;neurological|hepatorenal

The 3-week sulphasalazine syndrome strikes again.;"A 34-year-old lady developed a constellation of dermatitis, fever, lymphadenopathy and hepatitis, beginning on the 17th day of a course of oral sulphasalazine for sero-negative rheumatoid arthritis. Cervical and inguinal lymph node biopsies showed the features of severe necrotising lymphadenitis, associated with erythrophagocytosis and prominent eosinophilic infiltrates, without viral inclusion bodies, suggestive of an adverse drug reaction.A week later, fulminant drug-induced hepatitis, associated with the presence of anti-nuclear autoantibodies (but not with other markers of autoimmunity), and accompanied by multi-organ failure and sepsis, supervened. She subsequently died some 5 weeks after the commencement of her drug therapy.Post-mortem examination showed evidence of massive hepatocellular necrosis, acute hypersensitivity myocarditis, focal acute tubulo-interstitial nephritis and extensive bone marrow necrosis, with no evidence of malignancy. It is thought that the clinico-pathological features and chronology of this case bore the hallmarks of the so-called ""3-week sulphasalazine syndrome"", a rare, but often fatal, immunoallergic reaction to sulphasalazine.";hepatorenal

New mutations, polymorphisms, and rare variants in the ATM gene detected by a novel SSCP strategy.;The gene for ataxia-telangiectasia , ATM , spans about 150 kb of genomic DNA . ATM mutations are found along the entire gene , with no evidence of a mutational hot spot . Using DNA as the starting material , we screened the ATM gene in 92 A-T patients , using an optimized single-strand conformation polymorphism ( SSCP ) technique that detected all previously known mutations in the polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) segments being analyzed . To expedite screening , we sequentially loaded the SSCP gels with three different sets of PCR products that were pretested to avoid overlapping patterns . Many of the DNA changes we detected were intragenic polymorphisms . Of an expected 177 unknown mutations , we detected approximately 70 % , mostly protein truncating mutations ( that would have been detectable by protein truncation testing if RNA starting material had been available ) . Mutations have now been defined for every exon of the ATM gene . Herein , we present 35 new mutations and 34 new intragenic polymorphisms or rare variants within the ATM gene . This is the most comprehensive compilation of ATM polymorphisms assembled to date . Defining polymorphic sites as well as mutations in the ATM gene will be of great importance in designing automated methods for detecting mutations . .;neurological

Acute renal failure subsequent to the administration of rifampicin. A follow-up study of cases reported earlier.;A clinical presentation is made of a 2-3 year follow-up of six cases of acute renal failure that have been reported earlier. The patients had developed transient renal failure after the intermittent administration of rifampicin. The stage of olig-anuria lasted for 1-3 weeks, and five of the patients were treated by hemodialysis. Two of the patients died due to unrelated causes during the follow-up period. The four patients re-examined were clinically cured. Pathologic findings by light microscopy and immunofluorescence at biopsy were scarce. Nothing abnormal was seen by electron microscopy in two of the cases studied. Renal function was normal. In three cases the excretion at 131I-hippuran renography was slightly slowed. Although in the acute stage the renal lesions histologically appeared toxic, evidence suggestive of an immunological mechanism cannot be excluded.;hepatorenal
Methimazole-induced cholestatic jaundice.;Methimazole is a widely used and generally well-tolerated antithyroid agent. A 43-year-old woman had severe jaundice and itching 1 month after receiving methimazole (10 mg tid) and propranolol (20 mg tid) for treatment of hyperthyroidism. The patient continued treatment for another 4 days after the appearance of jaundice until she finished both medications. When seen at the emergency department 2 weeks later, she still had severe icterus, pruritus, and hyperbilirubinemia, formed mainly of the conjugated fraction. Methimazole-induced cholestasis was diagnosed, and propranolol therapy was resumed. Over the following 9 days, the symptoms improved and plasma bilirubin levels were normal after 12 weeks without methimazole. In rare cases within the first few weeks of therapy, this drug can cause severe and reversible cholestatic jaundice. Physicians and patients should be aware of this adverse effect so that, upon occurrence, they can discontinue methimazole therapy and avoid unnecessary invasive procedures.;neurological
Mutation of MSH3 in endometrial cancer and evidence for its functional role in heteroduplex repair.;Many human tumours have length alterations in repetitive sequence elements . Although this microsatellite instability has been attributed to mutations in four DNA mismatch repair genes in hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer ( HNPCC ) kindreds , many sporadic tumours exhibit instability but no detectable mutations in these genes . It is therefore of interest to identify other genes that contribute to this instability . In yeast , mutations in several genes , including RTH and MSH3 , cause microsatellite instability . Thus , we screened 16 endometrial carcinomas with microsatellite instability for alterations in FEN1 ( the human homolog of RTH ) and in MSH3 ( refs 12-14 ) . Although we found no FEN1 mutations , a frameshift mutation in MSH3 was observed in an endometrial carcinoma and in an endometrial carcinoma cell line . Extracts of the cell line were deficient in repair of DNA substrates containing mismatches or extra nucleotides . Introducing chromosome 5 , encoding the MSH3 gene , into the mutant cell line increased the stability of some but not all microsatellites . Extracts of these cells repaired certain substrates containing extra nucleotides , but were deficient in repair of those containing mismatches or other extra nucleotides . A subsequent search revealed a second gene mutation in HHUA cells , a missense mutation in the MSH6 gene . Together the data suggest that the MSH3 gene encodes a product that functions in repair of some but not all pre-mutational intermediates , its mutation in tumours can result in genomic instability and , as in yeast , MSH3 and MSH6 are partially redundant for mismatch repair . .;neurological|oncological

Metabolic involvement in adriamycin cardiotoxicity.;The cardiotoxic effects of adriamycin were studied in mammalian myocardial cells in culture as a model system. Adriamycin inhibited cell growth and the rhythmic contractions characteristic of myocardial cells in culture. A possible involvement of energy metabolism was suggested previously, and in this study the adenylate energy charge and phosphorylcreatine mole fraction were determined in the adriamycin-treated cells. The adenylate energy charge was found to be significantly decreased, while the phophorylcreatine mole fraction was unchanged. Such disparity suggests an inhibition of creatine phosphokinase. The addition of 1 mM adenosine to the myocardial cell cultures markedly increases the ATP concentration through a pathway reportedly leading to a compartmentalized ATP pool. In the adriamycin-treated cells, the addition of adenosine increased the adenylate charge and, concomitant with this inrcease, the cells' functional integrity, in terms of percentage of beating cells and rate of contractions, was maintained.;neurological|cardiovascular

Risk of transient hyperammonemic encephalopathy in cancer patients who received continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil with the complication of dehydration and infection.;From 1986 to 1998, 29 cancer patients who had 32 episodes of transient hyperammonemic encephalopathy related to continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) were identified. None of the patients had decompensated liver disease. Onset of hyperammonemic encephalopathy varied from 0.5 to 5 days (mean: 2.6 +/- 1.3 days) after the initiation of chemotherapy. Plasma ammonium level ranged from 248 to 2387 microg% (mean: 626 +/- 431 microg%). Among the 32 episodes, 26 (81%) had various degrees of azotemia, 18 (56%) occurred during bacterial infections and 14 (44%) without infection occurred during periods of dehydration. Higher plasma ammonium levels and more rapid onset of hyperammonemia were seen in 18 patients with bacterial infections (p=0.003 and 0.0006, respectively) and in nine patients receiving high daily doses (2600 or 1800 mg/m2) of 5-FU (p=0.0001 and < 0.0001, respectively). In 25 out of 32 episodes (78%), plasma ammonium levels and mental status returned to normal within 2 days after adequate management. In conclusion, hyperammonemic encephalopathy can occur in patients receiving continuous infusion of 5-FU. Azotemia, body fluid insufficiency and bacterial infections were frequently found in these patients. It is therefore important to recognize this condition in patients receiving continuous infusion of 5-FU.;hepatorenal|oncological

Effects of aminophylline on the threshold for initiating ventricular fibrillation during respiratory failure.;"Cardiac arrhythmias have frequently been reported in association with respiratory failure. The possible additive role of pharmacologic agents in precipitating cardiac disturbances in patients with respiratory failure has only recently been emphasized. The effects of aminophylline on the ventricular fibrillation threshold during normal acid-base conditions and during respiratory failure were studied in anesthetized open chest dogs. The ventricular fibrillation threshold was measured by passing a gated train of 12 constant current pulses through the ventricular myocardium during the vulnerable period of the cardiac cycle. During the infusion of aminophylline, the ventricular fibrillation threshold was reduced by 30 to 40 percent of the control when pH and partial pressures of oxygen (PO2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) were kept within normal limits. When respiratory failure was produced by hypoventilation (pH 7.05 to 7.25; PC02 70 to 100 mm Hg: P02 20 to 40 mm Hg), infusion of aminophylline resulted in an even greater decrease in ventricular fibrillation threshold to 60 percent of the control level. These experiments suggest that although many factors may contribute to the increased incidence of ventricular arrhythmias in respiratory failure, pharmacologic agents, particularly aminophylline, may play a significant role.";cardiovascular
Effects of pallidal neurotensin on haloperidol-induced parkinsonian catalepsy: behavioral and electrophysiological studies.;OBJECTIVE: The globus pallidus plays a critical role in movement regulation. Previous studies have indicated that the globus pallidus receives neurotensinergic innervation from the striatum, and systemic administration of a neurotensin analog could produce antiparkinsonian effects. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of pallidal neurotensin on haloperidol-induced parkinsonian symptoms. METHODS: Behavioral experiments and electrophysiological recordings were performed in the present study. RESULTS: Bilateral infusions of neurotensin into the globus pallidus reversed haloperidol-induced parkinsonian catalepsy in rats. Electrophysiological recordings showed that microinjection of neurotensin induced excitation of pallidal neurons in the presence of systemic haloperidol administration. The neurotensin type-1 receptor antagonist SR48692 blocked both the behavioral and the electrophysiological effects induced by neurotensin. CONCLUSION: Activation of pallidal neurotensin receptors may be involved in neurotensin-induced antiparkinsonian effects.;neurological

Regional mapping of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene and the phenylketonuria locus in the human genome.;"Phenylketonuria ( PKU ) is an autosomal recessive disorder of amino acid metabolism caused by a deficiency of the hepatic enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase ( PAH ; phenylalanine 4-monooxygenase , EC 1 . 14 . 16 . 1 ) . A cDNA clone for human PAH has previously been used to assign the corresponding gene to human chromosome 12 . To define the regional map position of the disease locus and the PAH gene on human chromosome 12 , DNA was isolated from human-hamster somatic cell hybrids with various deletions of human chromosome 12 and was analyzed by Southern blot analysis using the human cDNA PAH clone as a hybridization probe . From these results , together with detailed biochemical and cytogenetic characterization of the hybrid cells , the region on chromosome 12 containing the human PAH gene has been defined as 12q14 . 3----qter 3----qter . The PAH map position on chromosome 12 was further localized by in situ hybridization of 125I-labeled human PAH cDNA to chromosomes prepared from a human lymphoblastoid cell line . Results of these experiments demonstrated that the region on chromosome 12 containing the PAH gene and the PKU locus in man is 12q22----12q24 . 1 . These results not only provide a regionalized map position for a major human disease locus but also can serve as a reference point for linkage analysis with other DNA markers on human chromosome 12";neurological|hepatorenal

Retroviral-mediated gene transfer of human phenylalanine hydroxylase into NIH 3T3 and hepatoma cells.;Phenylketonuria ( PKU ) is caused by deficiency of the hepatic enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase ( PAH ) . A full-length human PAH cDNA sequence has been inserted into pzip-neoSV ( X ) , which is a retroviral vector containing the bacterial neo gene . The recombinant has been transfected into psi 2 cells , which provide synthesis of the retroviral capsid . Recombinant virus was detected in the culture medium of the transfected psi 2 cells , which is capable of transmitting the human PAH gene into mouse NIH 3T3 cells by infection leading to stable incorporation of the recombinant provirus . Infected cells express PAH mRNA , immunoreactive PAH protein , and exhibit pterin-dependent phenylalanine hydroxylase activity . The recombinant virus is also capable of infecting a mouse hepatoma cell line that does not normally synthesize PAH . PAH activity is present in the cellular extracts and the entire hydroxylation system is reconstituted in the hepatoma cells infected with the recombinant viruses . Thus , recombinant viruses containing human PAH cDNA provide a means for introducing functional PAH into mammalian cells of hepatic origin and can potentially be introduced into whole animals as a model for somatic gene therapy for PKU . .;hepatorenal

Nephrotoxic effects in high-risk patients undergoing angiography.;"BACKGROUND: The use of iodinated contrast medium can result in nephropathy. Whether iso-osmolar contrast medium is less nephrotoxic than low-osmolar contrast medium in high-risk patients is uncertain. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, prospective, multicenter study comparing the nephrotoxic effects of an iso-osmolar, dimeric, nonionic contrast medium, iodixanol, with those of a low-osmolar, nonionic, monomeric contrast medium, iohexol. The study involved 129 patients with diabetes with serum creatinine concentrations of 1.5 to 3.5 mg per deciliter who underwent coronary or aortofemoral angiography. The primary end point was the peak increase from base line in the creatinine concentration during the three days after angiography. Other end points were an increase in the creatinine concentration of 0.5 mg per deciliter or more, an increase of 1.0 mg per deciliter or more, and a change in the creatinine concentration from day 0 to day 7. RESULTS: The creatinine concentration increased significantly less in patients who received iodixanol. From day 0 to day 3, the mean peak increase in creatinine was 0.13 mg per deciliter in the iodixanol group and 0.55 mg per deciliter in the iohexol group (P=0.001; the increase with iodixanol minus the increase with iohexol, -0.42 mg per deciliter [95 percent confidence interval, -0.73 to -0.22]). Two of the 64 patients in the iodixanol group (3 percent) had an increase in the creatinine concentration of 0.5 mg per deciliter or more, as compared with 17 of the 65 patients in the iohexol group (26 percent) (P=0.002; odds ratio for such an increase in the iodixanol group, 0.09 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.02 to 0.41]). No patient receiving iodixanol had an increase of 1.0 mg per deciliter or more, but 10 patients in the iohexol group (15 percent) did. The mean change in the creatinine concentration from day 0 to day 7 was 0.07 mg per deciliter in the iodixanol group and 0.24 mg per deciliter in the iohexol group (P=0.003; value in the iodixanol group minus the value in the iohexol group, -0.17 mg per deciliter [95 percent confidence interval, -0.34 to -0.07]).

The recent discovery of the gene that is mutated in this condition , FRDA , has led to rapid advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis of Friedreich ataxia . About 98 % of mutant alleles have an expansion of a GAA trinucleotide repeat in intron 1 of the gene . This leads to reduced levels of the protein , frataxin . There is mounting evidence to suggest that Friedreich ataxia is the result of accumulation of iron in mitochondria leading to excess production of free radicals , which then results in cellular damage and death . Currently there is no known treatment that alters the natural course of the disease . The discovery of the FRDA gene and its possible function has raised hope that rational therapeutic strategies will be developed . .;neurological
Genomic structure of the EWS gene and its relationship to EWSR1, a site of tumor-associated chromosome translocation.;"The EWS gene has been identified based on its location at the chromosome 22 breakpoint of the t ( 11 ; 22 ) ( q24 ; q12 ) translocation that characterizes Ewing sarcoma and related neuroectodermal tumors . The EWS gene spans about 40 kb of DNA and is encoded by 17 exons . The nucleotide sequence of the exons is identical to that of the previously described cDNA . The first 7 exons encode the N-terminal domain of EWS , which consists of a repeated degenerated polypeptide of 7 to 12 residues rich in tyrosine , serine , threonine , glycine , and glutamine . Exons 11 , 12 , and 13 encode the putative RNA binding domain . The three glycine- and arginine-rich motifs of the gene are mainly encoded by exons 8-9 , 14 , and 16 . The DNA sequence in the 5 region of the gene has features of a CpG-rich island and lacks canonical promoter elements , such as TATA and CCAAT consensus sequences . Positions of the chromosome 22 breakpoints were determined for 19 Ewing tumors . They were localized in introns 7 or 8 in 18 cases and in intron 10 in 1 case . .";neurological|oncological
Neuroleptic malignant syndrome induced by combination therapy with tetrabenazine and tiapride in a Japanese patient with Huntington's disease at the terminal stage of recurrent breast cancer.;We herein describe the case of an 81-year-old Japanese woman with neuroleptic malignant syndrome that occurred 36 days after the initiation of combination therapy with tiapride (75 mg/day) and tetrabenazine (12.5 mg/day) for Huntington's disease. The patient had been treated with tiapride or tetrabenazine alone without any adverse effects before the administration of the combination therapy. She also had advanced breast cancer when the combination therapy was initiated. To the best of our knowledge, the occurrence of neuroleptic malignant syndrome due to combination therapy with tetrabenazine and tiapride has not been previously reported. Tetrabenazine should be administered very carefully in combination with other neuroleptic drugs, particularly in patients with a worsening general condition.;neurological|oncological
Missense mutation in the alternative splice region of the PAX6 gene in eye anomalies.;The PAX6 gene is involved in ocular morphogenesis , and PAX6 mutations have been detected in various types of ocular anomalies , including aniridia , Peters anomaly , corneal dystrophy , congenital cataract , and foveal hypoplasia . The gene encodes a transcriptional regulator that recognizes target genes through its paired-type DNA-binding domain . The paired domain is composed of two distinct DNA-binding subdomains , the N-terminal subdomain ( NTS ) and the C-terminal subdomain ( CTS ) , which bind respective consensus DNA sequences . The human PAX6 gene produces two alternative splice isoforms that have the distinct structure of the paired domain . The insertion , into the NTS , of 14 additional amino acids encoded by exon 5a abolishes the DNA-binding activity of the NTS and unmasks the DNA-binding ability of the CTS . Thus , exon 5a appears to function as a molecular switch that specifies target genes . We ascertained a novel missense mutation in four pedigrees with Peters anomaly , congenital cataract , Axenfeldt anomaly , and / or foveal hypoplasia , which , to our knowledge , is the first mutation identified in the splice-variant region . A T-- > A transition at the 20th nucleotide position of exon 5a results in a Val-- > Asp ( GTC-- > GAC ) substitution at the 7th codon of the alternative splice region . Functional analyses demonstrated that the V54D mutation slightly increased NTS binding and decreased CTS transactivation activity to almost half . .;neurological

Myocardial infarction in pregnancy associated with clomiphene citrate for ovulation induction: a case report.;BACKGROUND: Clomiphene citrate (CC) is commonly prescribed for ovulation induction. It is considered safe, with minimal side effects. Thromboembolism is a rare but life-threatening complication that has been reported after ovulation induction with CC. Spontaneous coronary thrombosis or thromboembolism with subsequent clot lysis has been suggested as one of the most common causes of myocardial infarction (MI) during pregnancy, with a subsequently normal coronary angiogram. CASE: A 33-year-old woman with a 5-week gestation had recently received CC for ovulation induction and presented with chest pain. An electrocardiogram showed a lateral and anterior wall myocardial infarction. Cardiac enzymes showed a peak rise in troponin I to 9.10 ng/mL. An initial exercise stress test was normal. At the time of admission, the patient was at high risk of radiation injury to the fetus, so a coronary angiogram was postponed until the second trimester. It showed normal coronary vessels. CONCLUSION: This appears to be the first reported case documenting a possible association between CC and myocardial infarction. Thrombosis might be a rare but hazardous complication of CC. Given this life-threatening complication, appropriate prophylactic measures should be used in high-risk woman undergoing ovarian stimulation.;cardiovascular

Accurate patient history contributes to differentiating diabetes insipidus: a case study.;This case study highlights the important contribution of nursing in obtaining an accurate health history. The case discussed herein initially appeared to be neurogenic diabetes insipidus (DI) secondary to a traumatic brain injury. The nursing staff, by reviewing the patient's health history with his family, discovered a history of polydipsia and long-standing lithium use. Lithium is implicated in drug-induced nephrogenic DI, and because the patient had not received lithium since being admitted to the hospital, his treatment changed to focus on nephrogenic DI. By combining information from the patient history, the physical examination, and radiologic and laboratory studies, the critical care team demonstrated that the patient had been self-treating his lithium-induced nephrogenic DI and developed neurogenic DI secondary to brain trauma. Thus successful treatment required that nephrogenic and neurogenic DI be treated concomitantly.;neurological|hepatorenal

Oral contraceptives and the risk of hereditary ovarian cancer.;"Hereditary Ovarian Cancer Clinical Study Group. BACKGROUND  Women with mutations in either the BRCA1 or the BRCA2 gene have a high lifetime risk of ovarian cancer . Oral contraceptives protect against ovarian cancer in general , but it is not known whether they also protect against hereditary forms of ovarian cancer . METHODS  We enrolled 207 women with hereditary ovarian cancer and 161 of their sisters as controls in a case-control study . All the patients carried a pathogenic mutation in either BRCA1 ( 179 women ) or BRCA2 ( 28 women ) . The control women were enrolled regardless of whether or not they had either mutation . Lifetime histories of oral-contraceptive use were obtained by interview or by written questionnaire and were compared between patients and control women , after adjustment for year of birth and parity . RESULTS  The adjusted odds ratio for ovarian cancer associated with any past use of oral contraceptives was 0 . 5 ( 95 percent confidence interval , 0 . 3 to 0 . 8 ) . The risk decreased with increasing duration of use ( P for trend , ovarian cancer both for carriers of the BRCA1 mutation ( odds ratio , 0 . 5 ; 95 percent confidence interval , 0 . 3 to 0 . 9 ) and for carriers of the BRCA2 mutation ( odds ratio , 0 . 4 ; 95 percent confidence interval , 0 . 2 to 1 . 1 ) .

5-azacytidine potentiates initiation induced by carcinogens in rat liver.;To test the validity of the hypothesis that hypomethylation of DNA plays an important role in the initiation of carcinogenic process, 5-azacytidine (5-AzC) (10 mg/kg), an inhibitor of DNA methylation, was given to rats during the phase of repair synthesis induced by the three carcinogens, benzo[a]-pyrene (200 mg/kg), N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (60 mg/kg) and 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (1,2-DMH) (100 mg/kg). The initiated hepatocytes in the liver were assayed as the gamma-glutamyltransferase (gamma-GT) positive foci formed following a 2-week selection regimen consisting of dietary 0.02% 2-acetylaminofluorene coupled with a necrogenic dose of CCl4. The results obtained indicate that with all three carcinogens, administration of 5-AzC during repair synthesis increased the incidence of initiated hepatocytes, for example 10-20 foci/cm2 in 5-AzC and carcinogen-treated rats compared with 3-5 foci/cm2 in rats treated with carcinogen only. Administration of [3H]-5-azadeoxycytidine during the repair synthesis induced by 1,2-DMH further showed that 0.019 mol % of cytosine residues in DNA were substituted by the analogue, indicating that incorporation of 5-AzC occurs during repair synthesis. In the absence of the carcinogen, 5-AzC given after a two thirds partial hepatectomy, when its incorporation should be maximum, failed to induce any gamma-GT positive foci. The results suggest that hypomethylation of DNA per se may not be sufficient for initiation. Perhaps two events might be necessary for initiation, the first caused by the carcinogen and a second involving hypomethylation of DNA.;hepatorenal

Thalidomide neuropathy in patients treated for metastatic prostate cancer.;We prospectively evaluated thalidomide-induced neuropathy using electrodiagnostic studies. Sixty-seven men with metastatic androgen-independent prostate cancer in an open-label trial of oral thalidomide underwent neurologic examinations and nerve conduction studies (NCS) prior to and at 3-month intervals during treatment. NCS included recording of sensory nerve action potentials (SNAPs) from median, radial, ulnar, and sural nerves. SNAP amplitudes for each nerve were expressed as the percentage of its baseline, and the mean of the four was termed the SNAP index. A 40% decline in the SNAP index was considered clinically significant. Thalidomide was discontinued in 55 patients for lack of therapeutic response. Of 67 patients initially enrolled, 24 remained on thalidomide for 3 months, 8 remained at 6 months, and 3 remained at 9 months. Six patients developed neuropathy. Clinical symptoms and a decline in the SNAP index occurred concurrently. Older age and cumulative dose were possible contributing factors. Neuropathy may thus be a common complication of thalidomide in older patients. The SNAP index can be used to monitor peripheral neuropathy, but not for early detection.;neurological|oncological

Structural abnormalities in the brains of human subjects who use methamphetamine.;"We visualize, for the first time, the profile of structural deficits in the human brain associated with chronic methamphetamine (MA) abuse. Studies of human subjects who have used MA chronically have revealed deficits in dopaminergic and serotonergic systems and cerebral metabolic abnormalities. Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and new computational brain-mapping techniques, we determined the pattern of structural brain alterations associated with chronic MA abuse in human subjects and related these deficits to cognitive impairment. We used high-resolution MRI and surface-based computational image analyses to map regional abnormalities in the cortex, hippocampus, white matter, and ventricles in 22 human subjects who used MA and 21 age-matched, healthy controls. Cortical maps revealed severe gray-matter deficits in the cingulate, limbic, and paralimbic cortices of MA abusers (averaging 11.3% below control; p < 0.05). On average, MA abusers had 7.8% smaller hippocampal volumes than control subjects (p < 0.01; left, p = 0.01; right, p < 0.05) and significant white-matter hypertrophy (7.0%; p < 0.01). Hippocampal deficits were mapped and correlated with memory performance on a word-recall test (p < 0.05). MRI-based maps suggest that chronic methamphetamine abuse causes a selective pattern of cerebral deterioration that contributes to impaired memory performance. MA may selectively damage the medial temporal lobe and, consistent with metabolic studies, the cingulate-limbic cortex, inducing neuroadaptation, neuropil reduction, or cell death. Prominent white-matter hypertrophy may result from altered myelination and adaptive glial changes, including gliosis secondary to neuronal damage. These brain substrates may help account for the symptoms of MA abuse, providing therapeutic targets for drug-induced brain injury.";neurological|cardiovascular

Nicotine potentiation of morphine-induced catalepsy in mice.;In the present study, effects of nicotine on catalepsy induced by morphine in mice have been investigated. Morphine but not nicotine induced a dose-dependent catalepsy. The response of morphine was potentiated by nicotine. Intraperitoneal administration of atropine, naloxone, mecamylamine, and hexamethonium to mice reduced catalepsy induced by a combination of morphine with nicotine. Intracerebroventricular injection of atropine, hexamethonium, and naloxone also decreased catalepsy induced by morphine plus nicotine. Intraperitoneal administration of atropine, but not intraperitoneal or intracerebroventricular injection of hexamethonium, decreased the effect of a single dose of morphine. It was concluded that morphine catalepsy can be elicited by opioid and cholinergic receptors, and the potentiation of morphine induced by nicotine may also be mediated through cholinergic receptor mechanisms.;neurological
Hemolytic-uremic syndrome associated with ingestion of quinine.;Hemolytic-uremic syndrome following quinine ingestion is a newly described phenomenon, with just two previous descriptions of 4 cases in the literature. We describe a 5th case. The reaction may be mediated by the presence of antibodies reactive against platelets in the presence of quinine. Treatment has included use of plasma exchange, prednisone, aspirin, and dipyridamole. The patients have all regained some degree of renal function. However, it is unclear whether pharmacological treatment or spontaneous resolution is responsible for the improvement. Quinine-associated hemolytic-uremic syndrome probably occurs more often than is recognized. It is important to recognize this reaction when it occurs and to avoid further quinine exposure, since the reaction seems to be recurrent.;neurological|hepatorenal
Intracranial pressure increases during alfentanil-induced rigidity.;Intracranial pressure (ICP) was measured during alfentanil-induced rigidity in rats. Ten rats had arterial, central venous (CVP), and subdural cannulae inserted under halothane anesthesia. The animals were mechanically ventilated to achieve normocarbia (PCO2 = 42 +/- 1 mmHg, mean +/- SE). Following instrumentation, halothane was discontinued and alfentanil (125 mu/kg) administered iv during emergence from halothane anesthesia. In the five rats that developed somatic rigidity, ICP and CVP increased significantly above baseline (delta ICP 7.5 +/- 1.0 mmHg, delta CVP 5.9 +/- 1.3 mmHg). These variables returned to baseline when rigidity was abolished with metocurine. In five rats that did not become rigid, ICP and CVP did not change following alfentanil. These observations suggest that rigidity should be prevented when alfentanil, and, presumably, other opiates, are used in the anesthetic management of patients with ICP problems.;neurological

Prevention of breast cancer with tamoxifen: preliminary findings from the Italian randomised trial among hysterectomised women. Italian Tamoxifen Prevention Study.;"BACKGROUND: Tamoxifen is a candidate chemopreventive agent in breast cancer, although the drug may be associated with the development of endometrial cancer. Therefore we did a trial in hysterectomised women of tamoxifen as a chemopreventive. METHODS: In October, 1992, we started a double-blind placebo-controlled, randomised trial of tamoxifen in women (mainly in Italy) who did not have breast cancer and who had had a hysterectomy. Women were randomised to receive tamoxifen 20 mg per day or placebo, both orally for 5 years. The original plan was to follow the intervention phase by 5 years' follow-up. In June, 1997, the trialists and the data-monitoring committee decided to end recruitment primarily because of the number of women dropping out of the study. Recruitment ended on July 11, 1997, and the study will continue as planned. The primary endpoints are the occurrence of and deaths from breast cancer. This preliminary interim analysis is based on intention-to-treat. FINDINGS: 5408 women were randomised; participating women have a median follow-up of 46 months for major endpoints. 41 cases of breast cancer occurred so far; there have been no deaths from breast cancer. There is no difference in breast-cancer frequency between the placebo (22 cases) and tamoxifen (19) arms. There is a statistically significant reduction of breast cancer among women receiving tamoxifen who also used hormone-replacement therapy during the trial: among 390 women on such therapy and allocated to placebo, we found eight cases of breast cancer compared with one case among 362 women allocated to tamoxifen. Compared with the placebo group, there was a significantly increased risk of vascular events and hypertriglyceridaemia among women on tamoxifen. INTERPRETATION: Although this preliminary analysis has low power, in this cohort of women at low-to-normal risk of breast cancer, the postulated protective effects of tamoxifen are not yet apparent. Women using hormone-replacement therapy appear to have benefited from use of tamoxifen. There were no deaths from breast cancer recorded in women in the study. It is essential to continue follow-up to quantify the long-term risks and benefits of tamoxifen therapy.";neurological|oncological

Performance in two or more cognitive tests was pathological in 10 cases . Fourteen patients had subcortical white matter lesions on MRI , 14 had cerebral atrophy . Amplification of the CTG repeat showed a strong correlation with cognitive test deficits when exceeding a length of over 1000 trinucleotides . MRI lesions were associated with impaired psychometric performance , but MRI and molecular findings were only weakly related . Disease duration influenced the appearance and amount of white matter lesions on MRI . Quantification of CTG repeat size may allow an early estimate on the probability of brain involvement in DM ; cognitive dysfunction is associated with white matter lesions and cerebral atrophy later on in the course . .";neurological
Phase II trial of vinorelbine in metastatic squamous cell esophageal carcinoma. European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Gastrointestinal Treat Cancer Cooperative Group.;"PURPOSE: To evaluate the response rate and toxic effects of vinorelbine (VNB) administered as a single agent in metastatic squamous cell esophageal carcinoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-six eligible patients with measurable lesions were included and were stratified according to previous chemotherapy. Thirty patients without prior chemotherapy and 16 pretreated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy were assessable for toxicity and response. VNB was administered weekly as a 25-mg/m2 short intravenous (i.v.) infusion. RESULTS: Six of 30 patients (20%) without prior chemotherapy achieved a partial response (PR) (95% confidence interval [CI], 8% to 39%). The median duration of response was 21 weeks (range, 17 to 28). One of 16 patients (6%) with prior chemotherapy had a complete response (CR) of 31 weeks' duration (95% CI, 0% to 30%). The overall response rate (World Health Organization [WHO] criteria) was 15% (CR, 2%; PR 13%; 95% CI, 6% to 29%). The median dose-intensity (DI) was 20 mg/m2/wk. VNB was well tolerated and zero instances of WHO grade 4 nonhematologic toxicity occurred. At least one episode of grade 3 or 4 granulocytopenia was seen in 59% of patients. A grade 2 or 3 infection occurred in 16% of patients, but no toxic deaths occurred. Other side effects were rare, and peripheral neurotoxicity has been minor (26% grade 1). CONCLUSION: These data indicate that VNB is an active agent in metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Given its excellent tolerance profile and low toxicity, further evaluation of VNB in combination therapy is warranted.";neurological|oncological
Toxic hepatitis induced by antithyroid drugs: four cases including one with cross-reactivity between carbimazole and benzylthiouracil.;OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to assess the occurrence of hepatic adverse effects encountered with antithyroid drugs. METHODS: Retrospective review of medical records of 236 patients with hyperthyroidism admitted in our department (in- or out-patients) from 1986 to 1992. RESULTS: Four patients (1.7%) were identified with toxic hepatitis which could reasonably be attributed to the use of antithyroid agent. Two patients had a cholestatic hepatitis induced by carbimazole (N  omercazole). Two others had a mixed (cholestatic and cytolytic) hepatitis following carbimazole. One of the latter two patients further experienced a cytolytic hepatitis which appeared after Benzylthiouracil (Basd  ne) had replaced carbimazole. Biological features of hepatitis disappeared in all cases after cessation of the incriminated drug, while biliary, viral and immunological searches were negative. Only 2 patients of our retrospective study experienced a mild or severe neutropenia. CONCLUSION: Toxic hepatitis is a potential adverse effect of antithyroid drugs which warrants, as for haematological disturbances, a pre-therapeutic determination and a careful follow-up of relevant biological markers. Moreover, hepatotoxicity may not be restricted to one class of antithyroid agents.;hepatorenal
Expression and imprinting of MAGEL2 suggest a role in Prader-willi syndrome and the homologous murine imprinting phenotype.;Prader-Willi syndrome ( PWS ) is caused by the loss of expression of imprinted genes in chromosome 15q11-q13 . Affected individuals exhibit neonatal hypotonia , developmental delay and childhood-onset obesity . Necdin , a protein implicated in the terminal differentiation of neurons , is the only PWS candidate gene to reduce viability when disrupted in a mouse model . In this study , we have characterized MAGEL2 ( also known as NDNL1 ) , a gene with 51 % amino acid sequence similarity to necdin and located 41 kb distal to NDN in the PWS deletion region . MAGEL2 is expressed predominantly in brain , the primary tissue affected in PWS and in several fetal tissues as shown by northern blot analysis . MAGEL2 is imprinted with monoallelic expression in control brain , and paternal-only expression in the central nervous system as demonstrated by its lack of expression in brain from a PWS-affected individual . The orthologous mouse gene ( Magel2 ) is located within 150 kb of NDN  , is imprinted with paternal-only expression and is expressed predominantly in late developmental stages and adult brain as shown by northern blotting , RT-PCR and whole-mount RNA in situ hybridization . Magel2 distribution partially overlaps that of NDN  , with strong expression being detected in the central nervous system in mid-gestation mouse embryos by in situ hybridization . We hypothesize that , although loss of necdin expression may be important in the neonatal presentation of PWS , loss of MAGEL2 may be critical to abnormalities in brain development and dysmorphic features in individuals with PWS . .;neurological

Acute renal failure after high-dose methotrexate therapy in a patient with ileostomy.;High-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) is an important treatment for Burkitt lymphoma, but can cause hepatic and renal toxicity when its clearance is delayed. We report a case of acute renal failure after HD-MTX therapy in a patient with ileostomy, The patient was a 3-year-old boy who had received a living-related liver transplantation for congenital biliary atresia. At day 833 after the transplantation, he was diagnosed with PTLD (post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder, Burkitt-type malignant lymphoma). During induction therapy, he suffered ileal perforation and ileostomy was performed. Subsequent HD-MTX therapy caused acute renal failure that required continuous hemodialysis. We supposed that intravascular hypovolemia due to substantial drainage from the ileostoma caused acute prerenal failure. After recovery of his renal function, we could safely treat the patient with HD-MTX therapy by controlling drainage from ileostoma with total parenteral nutrition.;hepatorenal|oncological

Dominant negative effect of the APC1309 mutation: a possible explanation for genotype-phenotype correlations in familial adenomatous polyposis.;Inactivation of the adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC ) gene product initiates colorectal tumorigenesis . Patients with familial APC ( FAP ) carry germ-line mutations in the APC gene and develop multiple colorectal adenomas and subsequent carcinomas early in life . The severity of the disease correlates with the position of the inherited APC mutation ( genotype-phenotype correlation ) . Together with the fact that both germ-line and sporadic APC mutations cluster in the central region of the APC gene , this points to a dominant negative effect of certain APC mutants . Loss of APC function was recently shown to result in enhanced beta-catenin- / Tcf-mediated transcription in colon epithelial cells . Here , we provide experimental evidence for a dominant negative effect of APC gene products associated with severe polyposis . Wild-type APC activity in beta-catenin- / Tcf-mediated transcription was strongly inhibited by a mutant APC that is truncated at codon 1309 . In contrast , mutant APC gene products that are associated with attenuated polyposis ( codon 386 or 1465 ) interfered only weakly with wild-type APC activity . These results suggest a molecular explanation for the genotype-phenotype correlation in FAP patients and support the idea that colorectal tumor growth might be , in part , driven by selection for a mutation in the mutation cluster region . .;oncological
Clinical comparison of cardiorespiratory effects during unilateral and conventional spinal anaesthesia.;BACKGROUND: Spinal anaesthesia is widely employed in clinical practice but has the main drawback of post-spinal block hypotension. Efforts must therefore continue to be made to obviate this setback OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cardiovascular and respiratory changes during unilateral and conventional spinal anaesthesia. METHODS: With ethical approval, we studied 74 American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA), physical status class 1 and 2 patients scheduled for elective unilateral lower limb surgery. Patients were randomly allocated into one of two groups: lateral and conventional spinal anaesthesia groups. In the lateral position with operative side down, patients recived 10 mg (2mls) of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine through a 25-gauge spinal needle. Patients in the unilateral group were maintained in the lateral position for 15 minutes following spinal injection while those in the conventional group were turned supine immediately after injection. Blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation were monitored over 1 hour. RESULTS: Three patients (8.1%) in the unilateral group and 5 (13.5%) in the conventional group developed hypotension, P= 0.71. Four (10.8%) patients in the conventional group and 1 (2.7%) in the unilateral group, P= 0.17 required epinephrine infusion to treat hypotension. Patients in the conventional group had statistically significant greater fall in the systolic blood pressures at 15, 30 and 45 minutes when compared to the baseline (P= 0.003, 0.001 and 0.004). The mean respiratory rate and oxygen saturations in the two groups were similar. CONCLUSION: Compared to conventional spinal anaesthesia, unilateral spinal anaesthesia was associated with fewer cardiovascular perturbations. Also, the type of spinal block instituted affected neither the respiratory rate nor the arterial oxygen saturation.;cardiovascular

Induction of the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome in a woman by exogenous androgen administration.;We documented airway occlusion during sleep and an abnormally high supraglottic resistance while awake in a 54-yr-old woman who had developed physical changes and the syndrome of obstructive sleep apnea while being administered exogenous androgens. When the androgens were withdrawn, the patient's physical changes, symptoms, sleep study, and supraglottic resistance all returned to normal. A rechallenge with androgen produced symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea that abated upon withdrawal of the hormone. Previous reports have favored a role of androgens in the pathogenesis of sleep apnea. Our report provides direct evidence for this role. Structural and functional measurements indicate that androgens exert a permissive or necessary action on the structural configuration of the oropharynx that predisposes to obstruction during sleep. Development of the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome must be considered a possible side effect of androgen therapy.;neurological

Mechanism of increased iron absorption in murine model of hereditary hemochromatosis : increased duodenal expression of the iron transporter DMT1 .;Hereditary hemochromatosis ( HH ) is a common autosomal recessive disorder characterized by tissue iron deposition secondary to excessive dietary iron absorption . We recently reported that HFE , the protein defective in HH , was physically associated with the transferrin receptor ( TfR ) in duodenal crypt cells and proposed that mutations in HFE attenuate the uptake of transferrin-bound iron from plasma by duodenal crypt cells , leading to up-regulation of transporters for dietary iron . Here , we tested the hypothesis that HFE- / - mice have increased duodenal expression of the divalent metal transporter ( DMT1 ) . By 4 weeks of age , the HFE- / - mice demonstrated iron loading when compared with HFE + / + littermates , with elevated transferrin saturations ( 68 . 4 % vs . 49 . 8 % ) and elevated liver iron concentrations ( 985 micrograms vs . 381 micrograms ) . By using Northern blot analyses , we quantitated duodenal expression of both classes of DMT1 transcripts  one containing an iron responsive element ( IRE ) , called DMT1 ( IRE ) , and one containing no IRE , called DMT1 ( non-IRE ) . The positive control for DMT1 up-regulation was a murine model of dietary iron deficiency that demonstrated greatly increased levels of duodenal DMT1 ( IRE ) mRNA . HFE- / - mice also demonstrated an increase in duodenal DMT1 ( IRE ) mRNA ( average 7 . 7-fold ) , despite their elevated transferrin saturation and hepatic iron content . Duodenal expression of DMT1 ( non-IRE ) was not increased , nor was hepatic expression of DMT1 increased . These data support the model for HH in which HFE mutations lead to inappropriately low crypt cell iron , with resultant stabilization of DMT1 ( IRE ) mRNA , up-regulation of DMT1 , and increased absorption of dietary iron .;neurological|hepatorenal
Phenylephrine but not ephedrine reduces frontal lobe oxygenation following anesthesia-induced hypotension.;"BACKGROUND: Vasopressor agents are used to correct anesthesia-induced hypotension. We describe the effect of phenylephrine and ephedrine on frontal lobe oxygenation (S(c)O(2)) following anesthesia-induced hypotension. METHODS: Following induction of anesthesia by fentanyl (0.15 mg kg(-1)) and propofol (2.0 mg kg(-1)), 13 patients received phenylephrine (0.1 mg iv) and 12 patients received ephedrine (10 mg iv) to restore mean arterial pressure (MAP). Heart rate (HR), MAP, stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO), and frontal lobe oxygenation (S(c)O(2)) were registered. RESULTS: Induction of anesthesia was followed by a decrease in MAP, HR, SV, and CO concomitant with an elevation in S(c)O(2). After administration of phenylephrine, MAP increased (51 +/- 12 to 81 +/- 13 mmHg; P < 0.001; mean +/- SD). However, a 14% (from 70 +/- 8% to 60 +/- 7%) reduction in S(c)O(2) (P < 0.05) followed with no change in CO (3.7 +/- 1.1 to 3.4 +/- 0.9 l min(-1)). The administration of ephedrine led to a similar increase in MAP (53 +/- 9 to 79 +/- 8 mmHg; P < 0.001), restored CO (3.2 +/- 1.2 to 5.0 +/- 1.3 l min(-1)), and preserved S(c)O(2). CONCLUSIONS: The utilization of phenylephrine to correct hypotension induced by anesthesia has a negative impact on S(c)O(2) while ephedrine maintains frontal lobe oxygenation potentially related to an increase in CO.";cardiovascular
Serotonin 6 receptor gene is associated with methamphetamine-induced psychosis in a Japanese population.;BACKGROUND: Altered serotonergic neural transmission is hypothesized to be a susceptibility factor for psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia. The serotonin 6 (5-HT6) receptor is therapeutically targeted by several second generation antipsychotics, such as clozapine and olanzapine, and d-amphetamine-induced hyperactivity in rats is corrected with the use of a selective 5-HT6 receptor antagonist. In addition, the disrupted prepulse inhibition induced by d-amphetamine or phencyclidine was restored by 5-HT6 receptor antagonist in an animal study using rats. These animal models were considered to reflect the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, and the above evidence suggests that altered 5-HT6 receptors are involved in the pathophysiology of psychotic disorders. The symptoms of methamphetamine (METH)-induced psychosis are similar to those of paranoid type schizophrenia. Therefore, we conducted an analysis of the association of the 5-HT6 gene (HTR6) with METH-induced psychosis. METHOD: Using five tagging SNPs (rs6693503, rs1805054, rs4912138, rs3790757 and rs9659997), we conducted a genetic association analysis of case-control samples (197 METH-induced psychosis patients and 337 controls) in the Japanese population. The age and sex of the control subjects did not differ from those of the methamphetamine dependence patients. RESULTS: rs6693503 was associated with METH-induced psychosis patients in the allele/genotype-wise analysis. Moreover, this association remained significant after Bonferroni correction. In the haplotype-wise analysis, we detected an association between two markers (rs6693503 and rs1805054) and three markers (rs6693503, rs1805054 and rs4912138) in HTR6 and METH-induced psychosis patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: HTR6 may play an important role in the pathophysiology of METH-induced psychosis in the Japanese population.;neurological
Severe-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency associated with chronic hemolytic anemia, granulocyte dysfunction, and increased susceptibility to infections: description of a new molecular variant (G6PD Barcelona).;Molecular , kinetic , and functional studies were carried out on erythrocytes and leukocytes in a Spanish male with G6PD deficiency , congenital nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia ( CNSHA ) , and increased susceptibility to infections . G6PD activity was absent in patients red cells and was about 2 % of normal in leukocytes . Molecular studies using standard methods ( WHO , 1967 ) showed G6PD in the patient to have a slightly fast electrophoretic mobility at pH 8 . 0 with otherwise normal properties ( heat stability at 46 degrees C , apparent affinity for substrates , optimum pH , and utilization of substrate analogues ) . Other tests showed the patients granulocytes to engulf latex particles normally , but to have impaired reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium and ferricytochrome-c as well as reduced iodination . Chemotaxis and random migration of the patients granulocytes were normal as were myeloperoxidase , leukocyte alkaline phosphatase ( LAP ) , and ultrastructural features . The molecular characteristics of G6PD in the patient differed from those of all previously reported variants associated with CNSHA , so the present variant was provisionally called G6PD Barcelona to distinguish it from other G6PD variants previously described . Possible mechanisms for the severe deficiency of G6PD in erythrocytes and granulocytes was investigated by studies on the immunologic specific activity of the mutant enzyme .;neurological
Growth retardation and tumour inhibition by BRCA1.;"Inherited mutations in BRCA1 predispose to breast and ovarian cancer , but the role of BRCA1 in sporadic breast and ovarian cancer has previously been elusive . Here , we show that retroviral transfer of the wild-type BRCA1 gene inhibits growth in vitro of all breast and ovarian cancer cell lines tested , but not colon or lung cancer cells or fibroblasts . Mutant BRCA1 has no effect on growth of breast cancer cells ; ovarian cancer cell growth is not affected by BRCA1 mutations in the 5 portion of the gene , but is inhibited by 3 BRCA1 mutations . Development of MCF-7 tumours in nude mice is inhibited when MCF-7 cells are transfected with wild-type , but not mutant , BRCA1 . Most importantly , among mice with established MCF-7 tumours , peritoneal treatment with a retroviral vector expressing wild-type BRCA1 significantly inhibits tumour growth and increased survival . .";oncological
Increase in intragastric pressure during suxamethonium-induced muscle fasciculations in children: inhibition by alfentanil.;"Changes in intragastric pressure after the administration of suxamethonium 1.5 mg kg-1 i.v. were studied in 32 children (mean age 6.9 yr) pretreated with either physiological saline or alfentanil 50 micrograms kg-1. Anaesthesia was induced with thiopentone 5 mg kg-1. The incidence and intensity of muscle fasciculations caused by suxamethonium were significantly greater in the control than in the alfentanil group. The intragastric pressure during muscle fasciculations was significantly higher in the control group (16 +/- 0.7 (SEM) cm H2O) than in the alfentanil group (7.7 +/- 1.5 (SEM) cm H2O). The increase in intragastric pressure was directly related to the intensity of muscle fasciculations (regression line: y = 0.5 + 4.78x with r of 0.78). It is concluded that intragastric pressure increases significantly during muscle fasciculations caused by suxamethonium in healthy children. Alfentanil 50 micrograms kg-1 effectively inhibits the incidence and intensity of suxamethonium-induced muscle fasciculations; moreover, intragastric pressure remains at its control value.";neurological

Anticonvulsant actions of MK-801 on the lithium-pilocarpine model of status epilepticus in rats.;MK-801, a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, was tested for anticonvulsant effects in rats using two seizure models, coadministration of lithium and pilocarpine and administration of a high dose of pilocarpine alone. Three major results are reported. First, pretreatment with MK-801 produced an effective and dose-dependent anticonvulsant action with the lithium-pilocarpine model but not with rats treated with pilocarpine alone, suggesting that different biochemical mechanisms control seizures in these two models. Second, the anticonvulsant effect of MK-801 in the lithium-pilocarpine model only occurred after initial periods of seizure activity. This observation is suggested to be an in vivo demonstration of the conclusion derived from in vitro experiments that MK-801 binding requires agonist-induced opening of the channel sites of the NMDA receptor. Third, although it is relatively easy to block seizures induced by lithium and pilocarpine by administration of anticonvulsants prior to pilocarpine, it is more difficult to terminate ongoing status epilepticus and block the lethality of the seizures. Administration of MK-801 30 or 60 min after pilocarpine, i.e., during status epilepticus, gradually reduced electrical and behavioral seizure activity and greatly enhanced the survival rate. These results suggest that activation of NMDA receptors plays an important role in status epilepticus and brain damage in the lithium-pilocarpine model. This was further supported by results showing that nonconvulsive doses of NMDA and pilocarpine were synergistic, resulting in status epilepticus and subsequent mortality.;neurological

Increased anxiogenic effects of caffeine in panic disorders.;The effects of oral administration of caffeine (10 mg/kg) on behavioral ratings, somatic symptoms, blood pressure and plasma levels of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenethyleneglycol (MHPG) and cortisol were determined in 17 healthy subjects and 21 patients meeting DSM-III criteria for agoraphobia with panic attacks or panic disorder. Caffeine produced significantly greater increases in subject-rated anxiety, nervousness, fear, nausea, palpitations, restlessness, and tremors in the patients compared with healthy subjects. In the patients, but not the healthy subjects, these symptoms were significantly correlated with plasma caffeine levels. Seventy-one percent of the patients reported that the behavioral effects of caffeine were similar to those experienced during panic attacks. Caffeine did not alter plasma MHPG levels in either the healthy subjects or patients. Caffeine increased plasma cortisol levels equally in the patient and healthy groups. Because caffeine is an adenosine receptor antagonist, these results suggest that some panic disorder patients may have abnormalities in neuronal systems involving adenosine. Patients with anxiety disorders may benefit by avoiding caffeine-containing foods and beverages.;neurological|cardiovascular

Combined androgen blockade-induced anemia in prostate cancer patients without bone involvement.;BACKGROUND: To determine the onset and extent of combined androgen blockade (CAB)-induced anemia in prostate cancer patients without bone involvement. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-two patients with biopsy-proven prostatic adenocarcinoma [26 with stage C (T3N0M0) and 16 with stage D1 (T3N1M0)] were included in this study. All patients received CAB [leuprolide acetate (LHRH-A) 3.75 mg, intramuscularly, every 28 days plus 250 mg flutamide, tid, per Os] and were evaluated for anemia by physical examination and laboratory tests at baseline and 4 subsequent intervals (1, 2, 3 and 6 months post-CAB). Hb, PSA and Testosterone measurements were recorded. Patients with stage D2-3 disease, abnormal hemoglobin level or renal and liver function tests that were higher than the upper limits were excluded from the study. The duration of the study was six months. RESULTS: The mean hemoglobin (Hb) levels were significantly declined in all patients from baseline of 14.2 g/dl to 14.0 g/dl, 13.5 g/dl, 13.2 g/dl and 12.7 g/dl at 1, 2, 3 and 6 months post-CAB, respectively. Severe and clinically evident anemia of Hb < 11 g/dl with clinical symptoms was detected in 6 patients (14.3%). This CAB-induced anemia was normochromic and normocytic. At six months post-CAB, patients with severe anemia had a Hb mean value of 10.2 +/- 0.1 g/dl (X +/- SE), whereas the other patients had mild anemia with Hb mean value of 13.2 +/- 0.17 (X +/- SE). The development of severe anemia at 6 months post-CAB was predictable by the reduction of Hb baseline value of more than 2.5 g/dl after 3 months of CAB (p = 0.01). The development of severe CAB-induced anemia in prostate cancer patients did not correlate with T baseline values (T < 3 ng/ml versus T > or = 3 ng/ml), with age (< 76 yrs versus > or = 76 yrs), and clinical stage (stage C versus stage D1). Severe and clinically evident anemia was easily corrected by subcutaneous injections (3 times/week for 1 month) of recombinant erythropoietin (rHuEPO-beta). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that rHuEPO-beta correctable CAB-induced anemia occurs in 14.3% of prostate cancer patients after 6 months of therapy.;neurological|hepatorenal|oncological

Sodium bicarbonate alleviates penile pain induced by intracavernous injections for erectile dysfunction.;In an attempt to determine whether penile pain associated with intracorporeal injections could be due to the acidity of the medication, we performed a randomized study comparing the incidence of penile pain following intracorporeal injections with or without the addition of sodium bicarbonate to the intracorporeal medications. A total of 38 consecutive patients who presented to our clinic with impotence received 0.2 ml. of a combination of 3 drugs: 6 mg. papaverine, 100 micrograms. phentolamine and 10 micrograms. prostaglandin E1 with (pH 7.05) or without (pH 4.17) the addition of sodium bicarbonate (0.03 mEq.). Of the 19 patients without sodium bicarbonate added to the medication 11 (58%) complained of penile pain due to the medication, while only 1 of the 19 men (5%) who received sodium bicarbonate complained of penile pain. From these data we conclude that the penile pain following intracorporeal injections is most likely due to the acidity of the medication, which can be overcome by elevating the pH to a neutral level.;neurological
Case report: pentamidine and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia revisited.;Pentamidine isethionate has been associated with ventricular tachyarrhythmias, including torsade de pointes. This article reports two cases of this complication and reviews all reported cases to date.

Torsade de pointes occurred after an average of 10 days of treatment with pentamidine. In these patients, no other acute side effects of pentamidine were observed. Torsade de pointes can be treated when recognized early, possibly without discontinuation of pentamidine.

Hereditary deficiency of the fifth component of complement in man.;II. Biological properties of C5-deficient human serum. The first known human kindred with hereditary deficiency of the fifth component of complement ( C5 ) was documented in the accompanying report . This study examines several biological properties of C5-deficient ( C5D ) human serum , particularly sera obtained from two C5D homozygotes . The proband , who has inactive systemic lupus erythematosus is completely lacking C5 , while her healthy half-sister has 1-2 % of normal levels . Both sera were severely impaired in their ability to generate chemotactic activity for normal human neutrophils upon incubation with aggregated human gamma-globulin or Escherichia coli endotoxin . This function was fully restored in the siblings serum , and substantially improved in the probands serum , by addition of highly purified human C5 to normal serum concentrations . Sera from eight family members who were apparently heterozygous for C5 deficiency gave normal chemotactic scores . The ability of C5D serum to opsonize Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( bakers yeast ) or Candida albicans for ingestion by normal neutrophils was completely normal . In addition , C5D serum was capable of promoting normal phagocytosis and intracellular killing of Staphylococcus aureus . The probands serum was incapable of mediating lysis of erythrocytes from a patient with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria in both the sucrose hemolysia and acid hemolysis tests , and also lacked bactericidal activity against sensitized or unsensitized Salmonella typhi . The siblings serum , containing only 1-2 % of normal C5 , effectively lysed S . typhi , but only at eightfold lower serum dilutions as compared to normals . These findings underscore the critical role of C5 in the generation of chemotactic activity and in cytolytic reactions , as opposed to a nonobligatory or minimal role in opsonization , at least for the organisms under study . .;neurological

Analysis of 17q haplotypes shows a recombination event in a bilateral breast cancer case which suggests that the BRCA1 gene lies distal to D17S857 ; D17S857 is thus the new proximal boundary for the region containing BRCA1 . Combining this information with previously published mapping information suggests that BRCA1 is contained in a region estimated at 1-1 . 5 Mb in length . All seven breast tumour / blood pairs examined from this family show loss of heterozygosity in the tumours . The allel retained in each tumour was from the disease-bearing chromosome implicating BRCA1 as a tumour suppressor gene .

Frequency of appearance of myeloperoxidase-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (MPO-ANCA) in Graves' disease patients treated with propylthiouracil and the relationship between MPO-ANCA and clinical manifestations.;OBJECTIVE: Myeloperoxidase antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (MPO-ANCA)-positive vasculitis has been reported in patients with Graves' disease who were treated with propylthiouracil (PTU). The appearance of MPO-ANCA in these cases was suspected of being related to PTU because the titres of MPO-ANCA decreased when PTU was stopped. Nevertheless, there have been no studies on the temporal relationship between the appearance of MPO-ANCA and vasculitis during PTU therapy, or on the incidence of MPO-ANCA in untreated Graves' disease patients. Therefore, we sought to address these parameters in patients with Graves' disease. PATIENTS: We investigated 102 untreated patients with hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease for the presence of MPO-ANCA, and for the development vasculitis after starting PTU therapy. Twenty-nine of them were later excluded because of adverse effects of PTU or because the observation period was less than 3 months. The remaining 73 patients (55 women and 18 men), all of whom were examined for more than 3 months, were adopted as the subjects of the investigation. The median observation period was 23.6 months (range: 3-37 months). MEASUREMENTS: MPO-ANCA was measured at intervals of 2-6 months. RESULTS: Before treatment, the MPO-ANCA titres of all 102 untreated Graves' disease patients were within the reference range (below 10 U/ml). Three (4.1%) of the 73 patients were positive for MPO-ANCA at 13, 16 and 17 months, respectively, after the start of PTU therapy. In two of them, the MPO-ANCA titres transiently increased to 12.8 and 15.0 U/ml, respectively, despite continued PTU therapy, but no vasculitic disorders developed. In the third patient, the MPO-ANCA titre increased to 204 U/ml and she developed a higher fever, oral ulcers and polyarthralgia, but the symptoms resolved 2 weeks after stopping PTU therapy, and the MPO-ANCA titre decreased to 20.7 U/ml by 4 months after discontinuing PTU. CONCLUSIONS: PTU therapy may be related to the appearance of MPO-ANCA, but MPO-ANCA does not appear to be closely related to vasculitis.;neurological

Treatment of compensatory gustatory hyperhidrosis with topical glycopyrrolate.;Gustatory hyperhidrosis is facial sweating usually associated with the eating of hot spicy food or even smelling this food. Current options of treatment include oral anticholinergic drugs, the topical application of anticholinergics or aluminum chloride, and the injection of botulinum toxin. Thirteen patients have been treated to date with 1.5% or 2% topical glycopyrrolate. All patients had gustatory hyperhidrosis, which interfered with their social activities, after transthroacic endoscopic sympathectomy, and which was associated with compensatory focal hyperhidrosis. After applying topical glycopyrrolate, the subjective effect was excellent (no sweating after eating hot spicy food) in 10 patients (77%), and fair (clearly reduced sweating) in 3 patients (23%). All had reported incidents of being very embarrassed whilst eating hot spicy foods. Adverse effects included a mildly dry mouth and a sore throat in 2 patients (2% glycopyrrolate), a light headache in 1 patient (1.5% glycopyrrolate). The topical application of a glycopyrrolate pad appeared to be safe, efficacious, well tolerated, and a convenient method of treatment for moderate to severe symptoms of gustatory hyperhidrosis in post transthoracic endoscopic sympathectomy or sympathicotomy patients, with few side effects.;neurological

Epileptogenic activity of folic acid after drug induces SLE (folic acid and epilepsy);OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of folic acid-containing multivitamin supplementation in epileptic women before and during pregnancy in order to determine the rate of structural birth defects and epilepsy-related side effects. STUDY DESIGN: First a randomised trial, later periconception care including in total 12225 females. RESULTS: Of 60 epileptic women with periconceptional folic acid (0.8 mg)-containing multivitamin supplementation, no one developed epilepsy-related side effects during the periconception period. One epileptic woman delivered a newborn with cleft lip and palate. Another patient exhibited with a cluster of seizures after the periconception period using another multivitamin. This 22-year-old epileptic woman was treated continuously by carbamazepine and a folic acid (1 mg)-containing multivitamin from the 20th week of gestation. She developed status epilepticus and later symptoms of systemic lupus erythematodes. Her pregnancy ended with stillbirth. CONCLUSIONS: The epileptic pregnant patient's autoimmune disease (probably drug-induced lupus) could damage the blood-brain barrier, therefore the therapeutic dose (> or =1 mg) of folic acid triggered a cluster of seizures. Physiological dose (<1 mg) of folic acid both in healthy and 60 epileptic women, all without any autoimmune disease, did not increase the risk for epileptic seizures.;neurological|hepatorenal

GEM-P chemotherapy is active in the treatment of relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma.;"Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is a relatively chemosensitive malignancy. However, for those who relapse, high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplant is the treatment of choice which relies on adequate disease control with salvage chemotherapy. Regimens commonly used often require inpatient administration and can be difficult to deliver due to toxicity. Gemcitabine and cisplatin have activity in HL, non-overlapping toxicity with first-line chemotherapeutics, and may be delivered in an outpatient setting. In this retrospective single-centre analysis, patients with relapsed or refractory HL treated with gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m(2) day (D)1, D8 and D15; methylprednisolone 1,000 mg D1-5; and cisplatin 100 mg/m(2) D15, every 28 days (GEM-P) were included. Demographic, survival, response and toxicity data were recorded. Forty-one eligible patients were identified: median age 27. One hundred and twenty-two cycles of GEM-P were administered in total (median 3 cycles; range 1-6). Twenty of 41 (48 %) patients received GEM-P as second-line treatment and 11/41 (27 %) as third-line therapy. Overall response rate (ORR) to GEM-P in the entire cohort was 80 % (complete response (CR) 37 %, partial response 44 %) with 14/15 CR confirmed as a metabolic CR on PET and ORR of 85 % in the 20 second-line patients. The most common grade 3/4 toxicities were haematological: neutropenia 54 % and thrombocytopenia 51 %. Median follow-up from the start of GEM-P was 4.5 years. Following GEM-P, 5-year progression-free survival was 46 % (95 % confidence interval (CI), 30-62 %) and 5-year overall survival was 59 % (95 % CI, 43-74 %). Fourteen of 41 patients proceeded directly to autologous transplant. GEM-P is a salvage chemotherapy with relatively high response rates, leading to successful transplantation in appropriate patients, in the treatment of relapsed or refractory HL.";hepatorenal|oncological

Phlorizin-induced glycosuria does not prevent gentamicin nephrotoxicity in rats.;"Because rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus (DM) have a high solute diuresis (glycosuria of 10 to 12 g/day), we have suggested that this may in part be responsible for their resistance to gentamicin-induced acute renal failure (ARF). The protection from gentamicin nephrotoxicity was studied in non-diabetic rats with chronic solute diuresis induced by blockage of tubular glucose reabsorption with phlorizin (P). DM rats with mild glycosuria (similar in degree to that of the P treated animals) were also studied. Unanesthetized adult female, Sprague-Dawley rats were divided in four groups and studied for 15 days. Group 1 (P alone) received P, 360 mg/day, for 15 days; Group II (P + gentamicin); Group III (gentamicin alone) and Group IV (mild DM + gentamicin). Nephrotoxic doses (40 mg/kg body wt/day) of gentamicin were injected during the last nine days of study to the animals of groups II to IV. In Group I, P induced a moderate and stable glycosuria (3.9 +/- 0.1 g/day, SE), and no functional or morphologic evidence of renal dysfunction (baseline CCr 2.1 +/- 0.1 ml/min, undetectable lysozymuria) or damage (tubular necrosis score [maximum 4], zero). In Group II, P did not prevent gentamicin-ARF (maximal decrease in CCr at day 9.89%, P less than 0.001; peak lysozymuria, 1863 +/- 321 micrograms/day; and tubular necrosis score, 3.9 +/- 0.1). These values were not different from those of Group III: maximal decrease in CCr 73% (P less than 0.001); lysozymuria, 2147 +/- 701 micrograms/day; tubular necrosis score, 3.8 +/- 0.1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)";neurological|hepatorenal

Common BRCA1 variants and susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer in the general population.;Most multiple case families of young onset breast cancer and ovarian cancer are thought to be due to highly penetrant mutations in the predisposing genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 . However , these mutations are uncommon in the population and they probably account for only a few percent of all breast cancer incidence . A much larger fraction of breast cancer might , in principle , be due to common variants which confer more modest individual risks . There are several common polymorphisms in the BRCA1 gene which generate amino acid substitutions . We have examined the frequency of four of these polymorphisms  Gln356Arg , Pro871Leu , Glu1038Gly and Ser1613Gly in large series of breast and ovarian cancer cases and matched controls . Due to strong linkage disequilibrium , these four sites generate only three haplotypes with a frequency > 1 . 3 % . The most common haplotypes , defined by the alleles Gln356Pro871Glu1038Ser1613 and Gln356Leu871Gly1038Gly1613 , have frequencies of 0 . 57 and 0 . 32 respectively , and these frequencies do not differ significantly between patient and control groups . Thus the most common polymorphisms of the BRCA1 gene do not make a significant contribution to breast or ovarian cancer risk . However , our data suggest that the Arg356 allele may have a different genotype distribution in breast cancer patients from that in controls ( Arg356 homozygotes are more frequent in the control groups , P = 0 . 01 ) , indicating that it may be protective against breast cancer . If this finding can be confirmed , it may provide an insight into the structural features of the BRCA1 protein that are important for its function .;neurological|oncological

Hyperkalemia associated with sulindac therapy.;Hyperkalemia has recently been recognized as a complication of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents (NSAID) such as indomethacin. Several recent studies have stressed the renal sparing features of sulindac, owing to its lack of interference with renal prostacyclin synthesis. We describe 4 patients in whom hyperkalemia ranging from 6.1 to 6.9 mEq/l developed within 3 to 8 days of sulindac administration. In all of them normal serum potassium levels reached within 2 to 4 days of stopping sulindac. As no other medications known to effect serum potassium had been given concomitantly, this course of events is suggestive of a cause-and-effect relationship between sulindac and hyperkalemia. These observations indicate that initial hopes that sulindac may not be associated with the adverse renal effects of other NSAID are probably not justified.;hepatorenal

The incidence of PAX6 mutation in patients with simple aniridia: an evaluation of mutation detection in 12 cases.;Twelve aniridia patients , five with a family history and seven presumed to be sporadic , were exhaustively screened in order to test what proportion of people with aniridia , uncomplicated by associated anomalies , carry mutations in the human PAX6 gene . Mutations were detected in 90 % of the cases . Three mutation detection techniques were used to determine if one method was superior for this gene . The protein truncation test ( PTT ) was used on RT-PCR products , SSCP on genomic PCR amplifications , and chemical cleavage of mismatch on both RT-PCR and genomic amplifications . For RT-PCR products , only the translated portion of the gene was screened . On genomic products exons 1 to 13 ( including 740 bp of the 3 untranslated sequence and all intron / exon boundaries ) were screened , as was a neuroretina specific enhancer in intron 4 . Ten of the possible 12 mutations in the five familial cases and five of the sporadic patients were found , all of which conformed to a functional outcome of haploinsufficiency . Five were splice site mutations ( one in the donor site of intron 4 , two in the donor site of intron 6 , one in each of the acceptor sites of introns 8 and 9 ) and five were nonsense mutations in exons 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , and 12 .

Effect of vincristine sulfate on Pseudomonas infections in monkeys.;"In rhesus monkeys, intravenous challenge with 0.6 x 10(10) to 2.2 x 10(10)Pseudomonas aeruginosa organisms caused acute illness of 4 to 5 days' duration with spontaneous recovery in 13 of 15 monkeys; blood cultures became negative 3 to 17 days after challenge. Leukocytosis was observed in all monkeys. Intravenous or intratracheal inoculation of 2.0 to 2.5 mg of vincristine sulfate was followed by leukopenia in 4 to 5 days. Intravenous inoculation of 4.2 x 10(10) to 7.8 x 10(10) pyocin type 6 Pseudomonas organisms in monkeys given vincristine sulfate 4 days previously resulted in fatal infection in 11 of 14 monkeys, whereas none of four receiving Pseudomonas alone died. These studies suggest that an antimetabolite-induced leukopenia predisposes to severe Pseudomonas sepsis and that such monkeys may serve as a biological model for study of comparative efficacy of antimicrobial agents.";neurological
The safety and efficacy of combination N-butyl-deoxynojirimycin (SC-48334) and zidovudine in patients with HIV-1 infection and 200-500 CD4 cells/mm3.;We conducted a double-blind, randomized phase II study to evaluate the safety and activity of combination therapy with N-butyl-deoxynojirimycin (SC-48334) (an alpha-glucosidase I inhibitor) and zidovudine versus zidovudine alone. Patients with 200 to 500 CD4 cells/mm3 who tolerated < or = 12 weeks of prior zidovudine therapy received SC-48334 (1000 mg every 8 h) and zidovudine (100 mg every 8 h) or zidovudine and placebo. Sixty patients received combination therapy and 58, zidovudine and placebo. Twenty-three patients (38%) and 15 (26%), in the combination and zidovudine groups, respectively, discontinued therapy (p = 0.15). The mean SC-48334 steady-state trough level (4.04 +/- 0.99 micrograms/ml) was below the in vitro inhibitory concentration for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The mean increase in CD4 cells at week 4 was 73.8 cells/mm3 and 52.4 cells/mm3 for the combination and zidovudine groups, respectively (p > 0.36). For patients with prior zidovudine therapy, the mean change in CD4 cells in the combination and zidovudine groups was 63.7 cells/mm3 and 4.9 cells/mm3 at week 8 and 6.8 cells/mm3 and -45.1 cells/mm3 at week 16, respectively. The number of patients with suppression of HIV p24 antigenemia in the combination and zidovudine groups was six (40%) and two (11%) at week 4 (p = 0.10) and five (45%) and two (14%) at week 24 (p = 0.08), respectively.

Efficacy and safety of granisetron, a selective 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 receptor antagonist, in the prevention of nausea and vomiting induced by high-dose cisplatin.;"PURPOSE: To assess the antiemetic effects and safety profile of four different doses of granisetron (Kytril; SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals, Philadelphia, PA) when administered as a single intravenous (IV) dose for prophylaxis of cisplatin-induced nausea and vomiting. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred eighty-four chemotherapy-naive patients receiving high-dose cisplatin (81 to 120 mg/m2) were randomized to receive one of four granisetron doses (5, 10, 20, or 40 micrograms/kg) administered before chemotherapy. Patients were observed on an inpatient basis for 18 to 24 hours, and vital signs, nausea, vomiting, retching, and appetite were assessed. Safety analyses included incidence of adverse experiences and laboratory parameter changes. RESULTS: After granisetron doses of 5, 10, 20, and 40 micrograms/kg, a major response (< or = two vomiting or retching episodes, and no antiemetic rescue) was recorded in 23%, 57%, 58%, and 60% of patients, respectively, and a complete response (no vomiting or retching, and no antiemetic rescue) in 18%, 41%, 40%, and 47% of patients, respectively. There was a statistically longer time to first episode of nausea (P = .0015) and vomiting (P = .0001), and fewer patients were administered additional antiemetic medication in the 10-micrograms/kg dosing groups than in the 5-micrograms/kg dosing group. As granisetron dose increased, appetite return increased (P = .040). Headache was the most frequently reported adverse event (20%). CONCLUSION: A single 10-, 20-, or 40-micrograms/kg dose of granisetron was effective in controlling vomiting in 57% to 60% of patients who received cisplatin at doses greater than 81 mg/m2 and totally prevented vomiting in 40% to 47% of patients. There were no statistically significant differences in efficacy between the 10-micrograms/kg dose and the 20- and 40-micrograms/kg doses. Granisetron was well tolerated at all doses.";neurological

Blood pressure response to chronic low-dose intrarenal noradrenaline infusion in conscious rats.;Sodium chloride solution (0.9%) or noradrenaline in doses of 4, 12 and 36 micrograms h-1 kg-1 was infused for five consecutive days, either intrarenally (by a new technique) or intravenously into rats with one kidney removed. Intrarenal infusion of noradrenaline caused hypertension at doses which did not do so when infused intravenously. Intrarenal compared with intravenous infusion of noradrenaline caused higher plasma noradrenaline concentrations and a shift of the plasma noradrenaline concentration-blood pressure effect curve towards lower plasma noradrenaline levels. These results suggest that hypertension after chronic intrarenal noradrenaline infusion is produced by relatively higher levels of circulating noradrenaline and by triggering of an additional intrarenal pressor mechanism.;neurological|cardiovascular|hepatorenal
Cancer incidence and metolachlor use in the Agricultural Health Study: An update.;UNASSIGNED: Metolachlor, a widely used herbicide, is classified as a Group C carcinogen by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency based on increased liver neoplasms in female rats. Epidemiologic studies of the health effects of metolachlor have been limited. The Agricultural Health Study (AHS) is a prospective cohort study including licensed private and commercial pesticide applicators in Iowa and North Carolina enrolled 1993-1997. We evaluated cancer incidence through 2010/2011 (NC/IA) for 49,616 applicators, 53% of whom reported ever using metolachlor. We used Poisson regression to evaluate relations between two metrics of metolachlor use (lifetime days, intensity-weighted lifetime days) and cancer incidence. We saw no association between metolachlor use and incidence of all cancers combined (n = 5,701 with a 5-year lag) or most site-specific cancers. For liver cancer, in analyses restricted to exposed workers, elevations observed at higher categories of use were not statistically significant. However, trends for both lifetime and intensity-weighted lifetime days of metolachor use were positive and statistically significant with an unexposed reference group. A similar pattern was observed for follicular cell lymphoma, but no other lymphoma subtypes. An earlier suggestion of increased lung cancer risk at high levels of metolachlor use in this cohort was not confirmed in this update. This suggestion of an association between metolachlor and liver cancer among pesticide applicators is a novel finding and echoes observation of increased liver neoplasms in some animal studies. However, our findings for both liver cancer and follicular cell lymphoma warrant follow-up to better differentiate effects of metolachlor use from other factors.;neurological|hepatorenal|oncological

Attenuation of the lithium-induced diabetes-insipidus-like syndrome by amiloride in rats.;The effect of amiloride on lithium-induced polydipsia and polyuria and on the lithium concentration in the plasma, brain, kidney, thyroid and red blood cells was investigated in rats, chronically treated with LiCl. Amiloride reduced the drinking and urine volume of rats in an acute (6 or 12 h) and a subacute (3 days) experiment. 6 h after the administration of amiloride, a reduction was observed in the lithium content of the renal medulla but not in the other organs studied. At 12 h, all the tissues showed a slight increase in lithium levels. After 3 days of combined treatment, a marked elevation in plasma and tissue lithium levels accompanied a reduction in water intake. In all the experiments, the attenuation of the lithium-induced diabetes-insipidus-like syndrome by amiloride was accompanied by a reduction of the ratio between the lithium concentration in the renal medulla and its levels in the blood and an elevation in the plasma potassium level. It is concluded that acute amiloride administration to lithium-treated patients suffering from polydipsia and polyuria might relieve these patients but prolonged amiloride supplementation would result in elevated lithium levels and might be hazardous.;neurological|hepatorenal

Frequent detection of codon 877 mutation in the androgen receptor gene in advanced prostate cancers.;Prostatic tissue specimens derived from transurethral resections of patients with metastatic prostate cancer were analyzed for genetic alterations in the hormone-binding domain of the androgen receptor ( AR ) gene . Direct sequencing of the polymerase chain reaction-derived DNAs of 6 of 24 specimens revealed a codon 877 mutation ( ACT-- > GCT , Thr-- > Ala ) in the hormone-binding domain of the AR gene . This same AR mutation has been reported previously in a metastatic prostate cancer cell line , LNCaP , where this mutation confers upon the AR an altered ligand-binding specificity which is stimulated by estrogens , progestagens , and antiandrogens . It is possible that analogous to an activated / altered growth factor receptor oncogene , codon 877 mutant AR with altered ligand binding may provide a selective growth advantage in the genesis of a subset of advanced prostate cancer . Although estrogens are used infrequently , antiandrogens are used increasingly in hormonal therapy for patients with advanced prostate cancer . The stimulatory effect of these therapeutic agents on the codon 877 mutant AR further suggests that this frequently observed AR mutation may contribute to the treatment refractory disease . .;oncological
Cholecystokinin-octapeptide restored morphine-induced hippocampal long-term potentiation impairment in rats.;Cholecystokinin-octapeptide (CCK-8), which is a typical brain-gut peptide, exerts a wide range of biological activities on the central nervous system. We have previously reported that CCK-8 significantly alleviated morphine-induced amnesia and reversed spine density decreases in the CA1 region of the hippocampus in morphine-treated animals. Here, we investigated the effects of CCK-8 on long-term potentiation (LTP) in the lateral perforant path (LPP)-granule cell synapse of rat dentate gyrus (DG) in acute saline or morphine-treated rats. Population spikes (PS), which were evoked by stimulation of the LPP, were recorded in the DG region. Acute morphine (30mg/kg, s.c.) treatment significantly attenuated hippocampal LTP and CCK-8 (1ug, i.c.v.) restored the amplitude of PS that was attenuated by morphine injection. Furthermore, microinjection of CCK-8 (0.1 and 1ug, i.c.v.) also significantly augmented hippocampal LTP in saline-treated (1ml/kg, s.c.) rats. Pre-treatment of the CCK2 receptor antagonist L-365,260 (10ug, i.c.v) reversed the effects of CCK-8, but the CCK1 receptor antagonist L-364,718 (10ug, i.c.v) did not. The present results demonstrate that CCK-8 attenuates the effect of morphine on hippocampal LTP through CCK2 receptors and suggest an ameliorative function of CCK-8 on morphine-induced memory impairment.;neurological
Topiramate-induced nephrolithiasis.;Topiramate is a recently developed antiepileptic medication that is becoming more widely prescribed because of its efficacy in treating refractory seizures.

Severe ocular and orbital toxicity after intracarotid injection of carboplatin for recurrent glioblastomas.;BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma is a malignant tumor that occurs in the cerebrum during adulthood. With current treatment regimens including combined surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, the average life expectancy of the patients is limited to approximately 1 year. Therefore, patients with glioblastoma sometimes have intracarotid injection of carcinostatics added to the treatment regimen. Generally, carboplatin is said to have milder side effects than cisplatin, whose ocular and orbital toxicity are well known. However, we experienced a case of severe ocular and orbital toxicity after intracarotid injection of carboplatin, which is infrequently reported. CASE: A 58-year-old man received an intracarotid injection of carboplatin for recurrent glioblastomas in his left temporal lobe. He complained of pain and visual disturbance in the ipsilateral eye 30 h after the injection. Various ocular symptoms and findings caused by carboplatin toxicity were seen. RESULTS: He was treated with intravenous administration of corticosteroids and glycerin for 6 days after the injection. Although the intraocular pressure elevation caused by secondary acute angle-closure glaucoma decreased and ocular pain diminished, inexorable papilledema and exudative retinal detachment continued for 3 weeks. Finally, 6 weeks later, diffuse chorioretinal atrophy with optic atrophy occurred and the vision in his left eye was lost. CONCLUSION: When performing intracarotid injection of carboplatin, we must be aware of its potentially blinding ocular toxicity. It is recommended that further studies and investigations are undertaken in the effort to minimize such severe side effects.;neurological|oncological
Recovery of tacrolimus-associated brachial neuritis after conversion to everolimus in a pediatric renal transplant recipient--case report and review of the literature.;TAC has been shown to be a potent immunosuppressive agent for solid organ transplantation in pediatrics. Neurotoxicity is a potentially serious toxic effect. It is characterized by encephalopathy, headaches, seizures, or neurological deficits. Here, we describe an eight-and-a-half-yr-old male renal transplant recipient with right BN. MRI demonstrated hyperintense T2 signals in the cervical cord and right brachial plexus roots indicative of both myelitis and right brachial plexitis. Symptoms persisted for three months despite TAC dose reduction, administration of IVIG and four doses of methylprednisolone pulse therapy. Improvement and eventually full recovery only occurred after TAC was completely discontinued and successfully replaced by everolimus.;neurological|hepatorenal

Over expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and its receptor during the development of estrogen-induced rat pituitary tumors may mediate estrogen-initiated tumor angiogenesis.;Estrogens, which have been associated with several types of human and animal cancers, can induce tumor angiogenesis in the pituitary of Fischer 344 rats. The mechanistic details of tumor angiogenesis induction, during estrogen carcinogenesis, are still unknown. To elucidate the role of estrogen in the regulation of tumor angiogenesis in the pituitary of female rats, the density of blood vessels was analysed using factor VIII related antigen (FVIIIRAg) immunohistochemistry and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor/vascular permeability factor (VEGF/VPF) was examined by Western blot and immunohistochemical analysis. The expression of VEGF receptor (VEGFR-2/Flk-1/KDR) was also examined by immunohistochemistry. The results demonstrated that 17beta-estradiol (E2) induces neovascularization, as well as the growth and enlargement of blood vessels after 7 days of exposure. The high tumor angiogenic potential was associated with an elevated VEGF/VPF protein expression in the E2 exposed pituitary of ovariectomized (OVEX) rats. VEGF/VPF and FVIIIRAg immunohistochemistry and endothelial specific lectin (UEA1) binding studies, indicate that the elevation of VEGF protein expression initially occurred in both blood vessels and non-endothelial cells. After 15 days of E2 exposure, VEGF/VPF protein expression, in the non-endothelial cell population, sharply declined and was restricted to the blood vessels. The function of non-endothelial-derived VEGF is not clear. Furthermore, immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that VEGFR-2 (flk-1/KDR), expression was elevated significantly in the endothelial cells of microblood vessels after 7 days of E2 exposure. These findings suggest that over expression of VEGF and its receptor (VEGFR-2) may play an important role in the initial step of the regulation of estrogen induced tumor angiogenesis in the rat pituitary.;oncological
Haplotype and multipoint linkage analysis in Finnish choroideremia families.;Multipoint linkage analysis of choroideremia ( TCD ) and seven X chromosomal restriction fragment length polymorphisms ( RFLPs ) was carried out in 18 Finnish TCD families . The data place TCD distal to PGK and DXS72 , very close to DXYS1 and DXYS5 ( Zmax = 24 at theta = 0 ) and proximal to DXYS4 and DXYS12 . This agrees with the data obtained from other linkage studies and from physical mapping . All the TCD males and carrier females studied have the same DXYS1 allele in coupling with TCD . In Northeastern Finland , 66 / 69 chromosomes carrying TCD had the same haplotype at loci DXS72 , DXYS1 , DXYS4 , and DXYS12 . The same haplotype is seen in only 15 / 99 chromosomes not carrying TCD . Moreover , in 71 / 104 non-TCD chromosomes , the haplotype at six marker loci is different from those seen in any of the 76 TCD chromosomes . This supports the previously described hypothesis that the large Northern Finnish choroideremia pedigrees , comprising a total of over 80 living patients representing more than a fifth of all TCD patients described worldwide , carry the same mutation . These linkage and haplotype data provide improved opportunities for prenatal diagnosis based on RFLP studies . .;neurological
Targeted modification of the apolipoprotein B gene results in hypobetalipoproteinemia and developmental abnormalities in mice.;Familial hypobetalipoproteinemia is an autosomal codominant disorder resulting in a dramatic reduction in plasma concentrations of apolipoprotein ( apo ) B , cholesterol , and beta-migrating lipoproteins . A benefit of hypobetalipoproteinemia is that mildly affected individuals may be protected from coronary vascular disease . We have used gene targeting to generate mice with a modified Apob allele . Mice containing this allele display all of the hallmarks of human hypobetalipoproteinemia  they produce a truncated apoB protein , apoB70 , and have markedly decreased plasma concentrations of apoB , beta-lipoproteins , and total cholesterol . In addition , the mice manifest several characteristics that are occasionally observed in human hypobetalipoproteinemia , including reduced plasma triglyceride concentrations , fasting chylomicronemia , and reduced high density lipoprotein cholesterol . An unexpected finding is that the modified Apob allele is strongly associated with exencephalus and hydrocephalus . These mice should help increase our understanding of hypobetalipoproteinemia , atherogenesis , and the etiology of exencephalus and hydrocephalus . .;cardiovascular
Relative efficacy and toxicity of netilmicin and tobramycin in oncology patients.;We prospectively compared the efficacy and safety of netilmicin sulfate or tobramycin sulfate in conjunction with piperacillin sodium in 118 immunocompromised patients with presumed severe infections. The two treatment regimens were equally efficacious. Nephrotoxicity occurred in a similar proportion in patients treated with netilmicin and tobramycin (17% vs 11%). Ototoxicity occurred in four (9.5%) of 42 netilmicin and piperacillin and in 12 (22%) of 54 tobramycin and piperacillin-treated patients. Of those evaluated with posttherapy audiograms, three of four netilmicin and piperacillin-treated patients had auditory thresholds return to baseline compared with one of nine tobramycin and piperacillin-treated patients. The number of greater than or equal to 15-dB increases in auditory threshold as a proportion of total greater than or equal to 15-dB changes (increases and decreases) was significantly lower in netilmicin and piperacillin- vs tobramycin and piperacillin-treated patients (18 of 78 vs 67 of 115). We conclude that aminoglycoside-associated ototoxicity was less severe and more often reversible with netilmicin than with tobramycin.;neurological|hepatorenal
Insulin gene region contributes to genetic susceptibility to, but may not to low incidence of, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in Japanese.;In the Caucasian population , it has been demonstrated that the insulin gene ( INS ) region contains the insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus locus ( IDDM2 ) . In the Japanese population , however , there has been no report demonstrating the contribution of IDDM2 to the pathogenesis of IDDM . We conducted an association study of IDDM in a large number of Japanese subjects with multiple polymorphisms in INS region . We found a significant association of the INS region with IDDM . Alleles positively associated with IDDM in INS region were the same as those positively-associated with IDDM in Caucasian population , although positively-associated alleles are very common ( allele frequencies > 0 . 9 ) in the Japanese general population . These data suggest that IDDM2 is involved in the genetic susceptibility to IDDM in Japanese . The high frequencies of disease-associated alleles in the general population suggest that IDDM2 locus is not responsible for the low incidence of IDDM in Japanese .;neurological
Rhabdomyolysis and brain ischemic stroke in a heroin-dependent male under methadone maintenance therapy.;OBJECTIVE: There are several complications associated with heroin abuse, some of which are life-threatening. Methadone may aggravate this problem. METHOD: A clinical case description. RESULTS: A 33-year-old man presented with rhabdomyolysis and cerebral ischemic stroke after intravenous heroin. He had used heroin since age 20, and had used 150 mg methadone daily for 6 months. He was found unconsciousness at home and was sent to our hospital. In the ER, his opiate level was 4497 ng/ml. In the ICU, we found rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure and acute respiratory failure. After transfer to an internal ward, we noted aphasia and weakness of his left limbs. After MRI, we found cerebral ischemic infarction. CONCLUSION: Those using methadone and heroin simultaneously may increase risk of rhabdomyolysis and ischemic stroke. Patients under methadone maintenance therapy should be warned regarding these serious adverse events. Hypotheses of heroin-related rhabdomyolysis and stroke in heroin abusers are discussed.;neurological|hepatorenal

Changes in peroxisomes in preneoplastic liver and hepatoma of mice induced by alpha-benzene hexachloride.;Peroxisomes in hepatomas and hyperplastic preneoplastic liver lesions induced in mice by 500 ppm alpha-benzene hexachloride were examined histochemically and electron microscopically. Although most of the hepatomas were well-differentiated tumors and contained a considerable number of peroxisomes, the tumor cells did not respond to ethyl-alpha-p-chlorophenoxyisobutyrate with proliferation of peroxisomes. At the 16th week of carcinogen feeding, hyperplastic nodules appeared and advanced to further stages. A majority of the nodules showed a considerable number of peroxisomes and the inductive proliferation of peroxisomes. Within the nodules, foci of proliferation of the cells that showed no inducibility of proliferation of peroxisomes appeared. These cells proliferated further, replacing the most part of the nodules, and with this process hepatomas appeared to have been formed. No abnormal matrical inclusions of peroxisomes were formed in the cells of hyperplastic nodules by ethyl-alpha-p-chlorophenoxyisobutyrate unlike in the case of rats.;hepatorenal|oncological
A single origin of phenylketonuria in Yemenite Jews.;Phenylketonuria ( PKU ) is a metabolic disease caused by recessive mutations of the gene encoding the hepatic enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase ( PAH ) . The incidence of PKU varies widely across different geographic areas , and is highest ( about 1 in 5 , 000 live births ) in Ireland and western Scotland , and among Yemenite Jews . A limited number of point mutations account for most of the PKU cases in the European population . Here we report that a single molecular defect--a deletion spanning the third exon of the PAH gene--is responsible for all the PKU cases among the Yemenite Jews . Examination of a random sample of Yemenite Jews using a molecular probe that detects the carriers of this deletion indicated a high frequency of the defective gene in this community . Although the deleted PAH gene was traced to 25 different locations throughout Yemen , family histories and official documents of the Yemenite Jewish community showed that the common ancestor of all the carriers of this genetic defect lived in Sana , the capital of Yemen , before the eighteenth century . .;hepatorenal
Somatic rearrangement of chromosome 14 in human lymphocytes.;Ataxia-telangiectasia is a rare genetic disorder associated with immune deficiency , chromosome instability , and a predisposition to lymphoid malignancy . We have detected chromosomally anomalous clones of lymphocytes in eight patients with this disorder . Chromosome banding disclosed that the clones are consistently marked by structural rearrangement of the long arm ( q ) of chromosome 14 . A translocation involving 14q was found in clones obtained from seven of the eight patients whereas a ring 14 chromosome was found in a clone obtained from the other . These findings as well as data obtained by others for patients with ataxia-telangiectasia suggest that structural rearrangement of 14q is the initial chromosomal change in lymphocyte clones of patients with this disorder . Chromosomes of lymphocytes from one of the patients were studied before and after the onset of chronic lymphocytic leukemia . Before leukemia was diagnosed , the patient had a lymphocyte clone with a 14q translocation . This clone appears to have given rise to the leukemic cells . We hypothesize that structural rearrangement of 14q is directly related to abnormal growth of lymphocytes and that it may be a step toward the development of lymphoid malignancies . Increasing evidence , provided by others , for the nonrandom involvement of 14q in African-type Burkitts lymphoma and other lymphoid neoplasms further strengthens this hypothesis . .;neurological|oncological

Molecular basis of human mitochondrial very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency causing cardiomyopathy and sudden death in childhood.;"beta-Oxidation of long-chain fatty acids provides the major source of energy in the heart .

We have isolated the human VLCAD cDNA and gene and determined the complete nucleotide sequences . Polymerase chain reaction amplification of VLCAD mRNA and genomic exons defined the molecular defects in two patients with VLCAD deficiency who presented with unexplained cardiac arrest and cardiomyopathy . In one , a homozygous mutation in the consensus dinucleotide of the donor splice site ( g + 1-- > a ) was associated with universal skipping of the prior exon ( exon 11 ) . The second patient was a compound heterozygote , with a missense mutation , C1837-- > T , changing the arginine at residue 613 to tryptophan on one allele and a single base deletion at the intron-exon 6 boundary as the second mutation . This initial delineation of human mutations in VLCAD suggests that VLCAD deficiency reduces myocardial fatty acid beta-oxidation and energy production and is associated with cardiomyopathy and sudden death in childhood .";cardiovascular|hepatorenal

Levetiracetam as an adjunct to phenobarbital treatment in cats with suspected idiopathic epilepsy.;OBJECTIVE: To assess pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and tolerability of oral levetiracetam administered as an adjunct to phenobarbital treatment in cats with poorly controlled suspected idiopathic epilepsy. DESIGN-Open-label, noncomparative clinical trial. ANIMALS: 12 cats suspected to have idiopathic epilepsy that was poorly controlled with phenobarbital or that had unacceptable adverse effects when treated with phenobarbital. PROCEDURES: Cats were treated with levetiracetam (20 mg/kg [9.1 mg/lb], PO, q 8 h). After a minimum of 1 week of treatment, serum levetiracetam concentrations were measured before and 2, 4, and 6 hours after drug administration, and maximum and minimum serum concentrations and elimination half-life were calculated. Seizure frequencies before and after initiation of levetiracetam treatment were compared, and adverse effects were recorded. RESULTS: Median maximum serum levetiracetam concentration was 25.5 microg/mL, median minimum serum levetiracetam concentration was 8.3 microg/mL, and median elimination half-life was 2.9 hours. Median seizure frequency prior to treatment with levetiracetam (2.1 seizures/mo) was significantly higher than median seizure frequency after initiation of levetiracetam treatment (0.42 seizures/mo), and 7 of 10 cats were classified as having responded to levetiracetam treatment (ie, reduction in seizure frequency of >or=50%). Two cats had transient lethargy and inappetence. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results suggested that levetiracetam is well tolerated in cats and may be useful as an adjunct to phenobarbital treatment in cats with idiopathic epilepsy.;neurological

Protective effect of Terminalia chebula against experimental myocardial injury induced by isoproterenol.;Cardioprotective effect of ethanolic extract of Terminalia chebula fruits (500 mg/kg body wt) was examined in isoproterenol (200 mg/kg body wt) induced myocardial damage in rats. In isoproterenol administered rats, the level of lipid peroxides increased significantly in the serum and heart. A significant decrease was observed in the activity of the myocardial marker enzymes with a concomitant increase in their activity in serum. Histopathological examination was carried out to confirm the myocardial necrosis. T. chebula extract pretreatment was found to ameliorate the effect of isoproterenol on lipid peroxide formation and retained the activities of the diagnostic marker enzymes.;cardiovascular
Mutations in the BRCA1 gene in families with early-onset breast and ovarian cancer.;We analysed 50 probands with a family history of breast and / or ovarian cancer for germline mutations in the coding region of the BRCA1 candidate gene , using single-strand conformation polymorphism ( SSCP ) analysis on PCR-amplified genomic DNA . A total of eight putative disease-causing alterations were identified  four of these are frameshifts and two are nonsense mutations . In addition , we found two missense mutations , one of which changes the final cysteine of the BRCA1 zinc finger motif to glycine . These data are consistent with a tumour suppressor model , and support the notion that this candidate gene is in fact BRCA1 . The heterogeneity of mutations , coupled with the large size of the gene , indicates that clinical application of BRCA1 mutation testing will be technically challenging . .;oncological

New founder haplotypes at the myotonic dystrophy locus in southern Africa.;"The association between normal alleles at the CTG repeat and two nearby polymorphisms in the myotonin protein kinase gene , the Alu insertion / deletion polymorphism and the myotonic dystrophy kinase ( DMK ) ( G / T ) intron 9 / HinfI polymorphism , has been analyzed in South African Negroids , a population in which myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) has not been described . South African Negroids have a CTG allelic distribution that is significantly different from that in Caucasoids and Japanese  the CTG repeat lengths of > or = 19 are very rare . The striking linkage disequilibrium between specific alleles at the Alu polymorphism ( Alu ( ins ) and Alu ( del ) ) , the HinfI polymorphism ( HinfI-1 and HinfI-2 ) , and the CTG repeat polymorphism seen in Caucasoid ( Europeans and Canadians ) populations was also found in the South African Negroid population . Numerous haplotypes , not previously described in Europeans , were , however , found . It thus seems likely that only a small number of these "" African "" chromosomes were present in the progenitors of all non-African peoples . These data provide support for the "" out of Africa "" model for the origin of modern humans and suggest that the rare ancestral DM mutation event may have occurred after the migration from Africa , hence the absence of DM in sub-Saharan Negroid peoples . .";neurological
Proliferation-related expression of p19/nm23 nucleoside diphosphate kinase.;"High level expression of the nm23-H1 gene , which encodes for a nucleoside diphosphate kinase , has been found to correlate with diminished metastasis in some tumors but not in others . We have previously identified the protein product of the nm23-H1 gene in two-dimensional electrophoretic gels and have designated it p19 / nm23 . In neuroblastoma , higher levels of p19 / nm23 , which are associated with amplification of the N-myc oncogene , large tumor mass , and metastasis , were observed in advanced stage tumors compared with limited stage disease . Because of the variable expression of nm23-H1 in different tumors , we have investigated the relationship between amounts of the protein and cell proliferation . The levels of p19 / nm23 were compared between resting and mitotically stimulated normal human PBLs and in leukemia cells . The amount of p19 / nm23 increased in normal lymphocytes in response to mitotic stimulation and paralleled the increase in DNA synthesis . In leukemia cells obtained from patients with different subtypes of acute leukemia , p19 / nm23 levels were also increased relative to resting normal lymphocytes . Treatment of mitotically stimulated lymphocytes with cyclosporin , which inhibits proliferation , blocked the increase in p19 / nm23 ; treatment of the leukemia cell line HL-60 with dimethylsulfoxide , which induces terminal differentiation , resulted in diminished levels of p19 / nm23 . Our data therefore provide evidence that nm23-H1 expression is related to cell proliferative activity . .";neurological|oncological

The flavonoid apigenin delays forgetting of passive avoidance conditioning in rats.;The present experiments were performed to study the effect of the flavonoid apigenin (20 mg/kg intraperitoneally (i.p.), 1 h before acquisition), on 24 h retention performance and forgetting of a step-through passive avoidance task, in young male Wistar rats. There were no differences between saline- and apigenin-treated groups in the 24 h retention trial. Furthermore, apigenin did not prevent the amnesia induced by scopolamine (1mg/kg, i.p., 30 min before the acquisition). The saline- and apigenin-treated rats that did not step through into the dark compartment during the cut-off time (540 s) were retested weekly for up to eight weeks. In the saline treated group, the first significant decline in passive avoidance response was observed at four weeks, and complete memory loss was found five weeks after the acquisition of the passive avoidance task. At the end of the experimental period, 60% of the animals treated with apigenin still did not step through. These data suggest that 1) apigenin delays the long-term forgetting but did not modulate the 24 h retention of fear memory and 2) the obtained beneficial effect of apigenin on the passive avoidance conditioning is mediated by mechanisms that do not implicate its action on the muscarinic cholinergic system.;neurological

Nephrotoxicity of cyclosporin A and FK506: inhibition of calcineurin phosphatase.;"Cyclosporin A (CsA; 50 mg/kg) and Fujimycine (FK506; 5 mg/kg), but not the related macrolide immunosuppressant rapamycin (5 mg/kg), caused a reduction of glomerular filtration rate, degenerative changes of proximal tubular epithelium, and hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in male Wistar rats when given for 10 days. The molecular mechanisms of CsA and FK506 toxicity were investigated. Cyclophilin A and FK506-binding protein, the main intracytoplasmic receptors for CsA and FK506, respectively, were each detected in renal tissue extract. In the kidney, high levels of immunoreactive and enzymatically active calcineurin were found which were inhibited by the immunosuppressants CsA and FK506, but not by rapamycin. Finally, specific immunophilin-drug-calcineurin complexes formed only in the presence of CsA and FK506, but not rapamycin. These results suggest that the nephrotoxic effects of CsA and FK506 is likely mediated through binding to renal immunophilin and inhibiting calcineurin phosphatase.";neurological|hepatorenal
Pentoxifylline (Trental) does not inhibit dipyridamole-induced coronary hyperemia: implications for dipyridamole-thallium-201 myocardial imaging.;Dipyridamole-thallium-201 imaging is often performed in patients unable to exercise because of peripheral vascular disease. Many of these patients are taking pentoxifylline (Trental), a methylxanthine derivative which may improve intermittent claudication. Whether pentoxifylline inhibits dipyridamole-induced coronary hyperemia like other methylxanthines such as theophylline and should be stopped prior to dipyridamole-thallium-201 imaging is unknown. Therefore, we studied the hyperemic response to dipyridamole in seven open-chest anesthetized dogs after pretreatment with either pentoxifylline (0, 7.5, or 15 mg/kg i.v.) or theophylline (3 mg/kg i.v.). Baseline circumflex coronary blood flows did not differ significantly among treatment groups. Dipyridamole significantly increased coronary blood flow before and after 7.5 or 15 mm/kg i.v. pentoxifylline (p less than 0.002). Neither dose of pentoxifylline significantly decreased the dipyridamole-induced hyperemia, while peak coronary blood flow was significantly lower after theophylline (p less than 0.01). We conclude that pentoxyifylline does not inhibit dipyridamole-induced coronary hyperemia even at high doses.;cardiovascular
International mexiletine and placebo antiarrhythmic coronary trial: I. Report on arrhythmia and other findings. Impact Research Group.;"The antiarrhythmic effects of the sustained release form of mexiletine (Mexitil-Perlongets) were evaluated in a double-blind placebo trial in 630 patients with recent documented myocardial infarction. The primary response variable was based on central reading of 24 hour ambulatory electrocardiographic recordings and was defined as the occurrence of 30 or more single premature ventricular complexes in any two consecutive 30 minute blocks or one or more runs of two or more premature ventricular complexes in the entire 24 hour electrocardiographic recording. Large differences, regarded as statistically significant, between the mexiletine and placebo groups were noted in that end point at months 1 and 4, but only trends were observed at month 12. These differences were observed even though the serum mexiletine levels obtained in this study were generally lower than those observed in studies that have used the regular form of the drug. There were more deaths in the mexiletine group (7.6%) than in the placebo group (4.8%); the difference was not statistically significant. The incidence of coronary events was similar in both groups. Previously recognized side effects, particularly tremor and gastrointestinal problems, were more frequent in the mexiletine group than in the placebo group.";neurological|cardiovascular
Assessment of cardiomyocyte DNA synthesis during hypertrophy in adult mice.;The ability of cardiomyocytes to synthesize DNA in response to experimentally induced cardiac hypertrophy was assessed in adult mice. Isoproterenol delivered by osmotic minipump implantation in adult C3Heb/FeJ mice resulted in a 46% increase in heart weight and a 19.3% increase in cardiomyocyte area. No DNA synthesis, as assessed by autoradiographic analysis of isolated cardiomyocytes, was observed in control or hypertrophic hearts. A survey of 15 independent inbred strains of mice revealed that ventricular cardiomyocyte nuclear number ranged from 3 to 13% mononucleate, suggesting that cardiomyocyte terminal differentiation is influenced directly or indirectly by genetic background. To determine whether the capacity for reactive DNA synthesis was also subject to genetic regulation, cardiac hypertrophy was induced in the strains of mice comprising the extremes of the nuclear number survey. These data indicate that adult mouse atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes do not synthesize DNA in response to isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy.;cardiovascular|hepatorenal
Persistent sterile leukocyturia is associated with impaired renal function in human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected children treated with indinavir.;BACKGROUND: Prolonged administration of indinavir is associated with the occurrence of a variety of renal complications in adults. These well-documented side effects have restricted the use of this potent protease inhibitor in children. DESIGN: A prospective study to monitor indinavir-related nephrotoxicity in a cohort of 30 human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected children treated with indinavir. METHODS: Urinary pH, albumin, creatinine, the presence of erythrocytes, leukocytes, bacteria and crystals, and culture were analyzed every 3 months for 96 weeks. Serum creatinine levels were routinely determined at the same time points. Steady-state pharmacokinetics of indinavir were done at week 4 after the initiation of indinavir. RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of persistent sterile leukocyturia (> or =75 cells/ micro L in at least 2 consecutive visits) after 96 weeks was 53%. Persistent sterile leukocyturia was frequently associated with a mild increase in the urine albumin/creatinine ratio and by microscopic hematuria. The cumulative incidence of serum creatinine levels >50% above normal was 33% after 96 weeks. Children with persistent sterile leukocyturia more frequently had serum creatinine levels of 50% above normal than those children without persistent sterile leukocyturia. In children younger than 5.6 years, persistent sterile leukocyturia was significantly more frequent than in older children. A higher cumulative incidence of persistent leukocyturia was found in children with an area under the curve >19 mg/L x h or a peak serum level of indinavir >12 mg/L. In 4 children, indinavir was discontinued because of nephrotoxicity. Subsequently, the serum creatinine levels decreased, the urine albumin/creatinine ratios returned to zero, and the leukocyturia disappeared within 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: Children treated with indinavir have a high cumulative incidence of persistent sterile leukocyturia. Children with persistent sterile leukocyturia more frequently had an increase in serum creatinine levels of >50% above normal. Younger children have an additional risk for renal complications. The impairment of the renal function in these children occurred in the absence of clinical symptoms of nephrolithiasis. Indinavir-associated nephrotoxicity must be monitored closely, especially in children with risk factors such as persistent sterile leukocyturia, age <5.6 years, an area under the curve of indinavir >19 mg/L x h, and a C(max) >12 mg/L.;neurological|hepatorenal

Molecular genetics of PKU in eastern Europe: a nonsense mutation associated with haplotype 4 of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene.;Phenylketonuria ( PKU ) is a genetic disorder secondary to a deficiency of hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase ( PAH ) . Several mutations in the PAH gene have recently been reported , and linkage disequilibrium was observed between RFLP haplotypes and specific mutations . A new molecular lesion has been identified in exon 7 of the PAH gene in a Hungarian PKU patient by direct sequencing of PCR-amplified DNA . The C-to-T transition causes the substitution of Arg243 to a termination codon , and the mutant allele is associated with haplotype 4 of the PAH gene . The mutation is present in two of nine mutant haplotype 4 alleles among Eastern Europeans and is not present among Western Europeans and Asians . The rarity of this mutant allele and its restricted geographic distribution suggest that the mutational event occurred recently on a normal haplotype 4 background in Eastern Europe . .;hepatorenal

Dose-related beneficial and adverse effects of dietary corticosterone on organophosphorus-induced delayed neuropathy in chickens.;Tri-ortho-tolyl phosphate (TOTP), 360 mg/kg, po, and 0,0'-diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate (DFP), 1 mg/kg sc, were administered to adult White Leghorn chickens 24 hr after they were placed on diets containing 0 to 300 ppm corticosterone. Supplemented diets were continued until clinical signs and lesions of delayed neuropathy appeared. Although low concentrations (less than or equal to 50 ppm) of corticosterone had beneficial effects on TOTP-induced neuropathy, greater than or equal to 200 ppm exacerbated clinical signs in chickens given either TOTP or DFP. Neurotoxic esterase activities 24 hr after TOTP or DFP were less than 20% of values measured in chickens not given organophosphorous compounds. Chickens given 200 ppm corticosterone without TOTP or DFP had significantly elevated activity of plasma cholinesterase and significantly inhibited activity of liver carboxylesterase. Degenerating myelinated fibers were also evident in distal levels of the peripheral nerves of chickens given TOTP or DFP.;neurological|hepatorenal

Procaterol and terbutaline in bronchial asthma. A double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study.;Procaterol, a new beta-2 adrenoceptor stimulant, was studied in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial in patients with bronchial asthma. Oral procaterol 50 micrograms b.d., procaterol 100 micrograms b.d., and terbutaline 5 mg t.i.d., were compared when given randomly in 1-week treatment periods. The best clinical effect was found with terbutaline. Both anti-asthmatic and tremorgenic effects of procaterol were dose-related. Procaterol appeared effective in the doses tested, and a twice daily regimen would appear to be suitable with this drug.;neurological
Combined antiretroviral therapy causes cardiomyopathy and elevates plasma lactate in transgenic AIDS mice.;"Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is implicated in cardiomyopathy (CM) and in elevated plasma lactate (LA) in AIDS through mechanisms of mitochondrial dysfunction. To determine mitochondrial events from HAART in vivo, 8-week-old hemizygous transgenic AIDS mice (NL4-3Delta gag/pol; TG) and wild-type FVB/n littermates were treated with the HAART combination of zidovudine, lamivudine, and indinavir or vehicle control for 10 days or 35 days. At termination of the experiments, mice underwent echocardiography, quantitation of abundance of molecular markers of CM (ventricular mRNA encoding atrial natriuretic factor [ANF] and sarcoplasmic calcium ATPase [SERCA2]), and determination of plasma LA. Myocardial histologic features were analyzed semiquantitatively and results were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. After 35 days in the TG + HAART cohort, left ventricular mass increased 160% by echocardiography. Molecularly, ANF mRNA increased 250% and SERCA2 mRNA decreased 57%. Biochemically, LA was elevated (8.5 +/- 2.0 mM). Pathologically, granular cytoplasmic changes were found in cardiac myocytes, indicating enlarged, damaged mitochondria. Findings were confirmed ultrastructurally. No changes were found in other cohorts. After 10 days, only ANF was elevated, and only in the TG + HAART cohort. Results show that cumulative HAART caused mitochondrial CM with elevated LA in AIDS transgenic mice.";neurological|cardiovascular
Hypotension as a manifestation of cardiotoxicity in three patients receiving cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil.;Cardiac symptoms, including hypotension, developed in three patients with advanced colorectal carcinoma while being treated with cisplatin (CDDP) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). In two patients, hypotension was associated with severe left ventricular dysfunction. All three patients required therapy discontinuation. Cardiac enzymes remained normal despite transient electrocardiographic (EKG) changes. The presentation and cardiac evaluation (hemodynamic, echocardiographic, and scintigraphic) of these patients suggest new manifestations of 5-FU cardiotoxicity that may be influenced by CDDP.

Some Mexican glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase variants revisited.;Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase ( G6PD ) deficiency appears to be fairly common in Mexico . We have now examined the DNA of three previously reported electrophoretically fast Mexican G6PD variants , -G6PD Distrito Federal , G6PD Tepic , and G6PD Castilla . All three of these variants , believed on the basis of biochemical characterization and population origin to be unique , have the G----A transition at nucleotide 202 and the A----G transition at nucleotide 376 , mutations that we now recognize to be characteristic of G6PD A- . Two other Mexican males with G6PD deficiency were found to have the same mutation . All five have the ( NlaIII / FokI / PvuII / PstI ) haplotype characteristic of G6PD A -in Africa . Since the PvuII + genotype seems to be rare in Europe , we conclude that all of these G6PD A - genes had their ancient origin in Africa , although in many of the Mexican patients with G6PD A -202A / 376G the gene may have been imported more recently from Spain , where this variant , formerly known as G6PD Betica , is also prevalent . .;neurological

A phase I/II study of paclitaxel plus cisplatin as first-line therapy for head and neck cancers: preliminary results.;"Improved outcomes among patients with head and neck carcinomas require investigations of new drugs for induction therapy. Preliminary results of an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group study of single-agent paclitaxel (Taxol; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ) reported a 37% response rate in patients with head and neck cancer, and the paclitaxel/cisplatin combination has been used successfully and has significantly improved median response duration in ovarian cancer patients. We initiated a phase I/II trial to determine the response and toxicity of escalating paclitaxel doses combined with fixed-dose cisplatin with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support in patients with untreated locally advanced inoperable head and neck carcinoma. To date, 23 men with a median age of 50 years and good performance status have entered the trial. Primary tumor sites were oropharynx, 10 patients; hypopharynx, four; larynx, two; oral cavity, three; unknown primary, two; and nasal cavity and parotid gland, one each. Of 20 patients evaluable for toxicity, four had stage III and 16 had stage IV disease. Treatment, given every 21 days for a maximum of three cycles, consisted of paclitaxel by 3-hour infusion followed the next day by a fixed dose of cisplatin (75 mg/m2). The dose levels incorporate escalating paclitaxel doses, and intrapatient escalations within a given dose level are permitted if toxicity permits. At the time of this writing, dose level 4 (260, 270, and 280 mg/m2) is being evaluated; three patients from this level are evaluable. With paclitaxel doses of 200 mg/m2 and higher, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor 5 micrograms/kg/d is given (days 4 through 12). Of 18 patients evaluable for response, seven (39%) achieved a complete response and six (33%) achieved a partial response. Three patients had no change and disease progressed in two. The overall response rate is 72%. Eleven responding patients had subsequent surgery/radiotherapy or radical radiotherapy. Two pathologic complete responses were observed in patients who had achieved clinical complete responses. Alopecia, paresthesias, and arthralgias/myalgias have occurred frequently, but with one exception (a grade 3 myalgia) they have been grade 1 or 2. No dose-limiting hematologic toxicity has been seen. Paclitaxel/cisplatin is an effective first-line regimen for locoregionally advanced head and neck cancer and continued study is warranted. Results thus far suggest no dose-response effect for paclitaxel doses above 200 mg/m2.";neurological|oncological
The carrier frequency of the BRCA1 185delAG mutation is approximately 1 percent in Ashkenazi Jewish individuals.;Since BRCA1 , the first major gene responsible for inherited breast cancer , was cloned , more than 50 unique mutations have been detected in the germline of individuals with breast and ovarian cancer . In high-risk pedigrees , female carriers of BRCA1 mutations have an 80-90 % lifetime risk of breast cancer , and a 40-50 % risk of ovarian cancer . However , the mutation stats of individuals unselected for breast or ovarian cancer has not been determined , and it is not known whether mutations in such individuals confer the same risk of cancer as in individuals from the high-risk families studied so far . Following the finding of a 185delAG frameshift mutation in several Ashkenazi Jewish breast / ovarian families , we have determined the frequency of this mutation in 858 Ashkenazim seeking genetic testing for conditions unrelated to cancer , and in 815 reference individuals not selected for ethnic origin . We observed the 185delAG mutation in 0 . 9 % of Ashkenazim ( 95 % confidence limit , 0 . 4-1 . 8 % ) and in none of the reference samples . Our results suggest that one in a hundred women of Ashkenazi descent may be at especially high risk of developing breast and / or ovarian cancer .;oncological

Electron microscopic investigations of the cyclophosphamide-induced lesions of the urinary bladder of the rat and their prevention by mesna.;Fully developed cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis is characterized by nearly complete detachment of the urothelium, severe submucosal edema owing to damage to the microvascular bed and focal muscle necroses. The initial response to the primary attack by the cyclophosphamide metabolites seems to be fragmentation of the luminal membrane. This damages the cellular barrier against the hypertonic urine. Subsequent breaks in the lateral cell membranes of the superficial cells and in all the plasma membranes of the intermediate and basal cells, intercellular and intracellular edema and disintegration of the desmosomes and hemidesmosomes lead to progressive degeneration and detachment of the epithelial cells with exposure and splitting of the basal membrane. The morphological changes of the endothelial cells, which become more pronounced in the later stages of the experiment, the involvement of blood vessels regardless of their diameter and the location-dependent extent of the damage indicate a direct type of damage which is preceded by a mediator-induced increase in permeability, the morphological correlate of which is the formation of gaps in the interendothelial cell connections on the venules. These changes can be effectively prevented by mesna. The only sign of a possible involvement is the increase in the number of specific granules with a presumed lysosomal function in the superficial cells.;neurological
A point mutation Thr(799)Met on the alpha(2) integrin leads to the formation of new human platelet alloantigen Sit(a) and affects collagen-induced aggregation.;A new platelet-specific alloantigen , termed Sit ( a ) , was identified in a severe case of neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia . The Sit ( a ) alloantigen is of low frequency ( 1 / 400 ) in the German population . Immunochemical studies demonstrated that the Sit ( a ) epitopes reside on platelet glycoprotein ( GP ) Ia . Nucleotide sequence analysis of GPIa cDNA derived from Sit ( a ) -positive platelets showed C ( 2531 ) -- > T ( 2531 ) point mutation , resulting in Thr ( 799 ) Met dimorphism . Analysis of genomic DNA from 22 Sit ( a ) -negative normal individuals showed that the Thr ( 799 ) is encoded by ACG ( 2532 ) ( 90 . 9 % ) or ACA ( 2532 ) ( 9 . 1 % ) . To establish a DNA typing technique , we elucidated the organization of the GPIa gene adjacent to the polymorphic bases . The introns ( 421 bp and 1 . 2 kb ) encompass a 142-bp exon with the 2 polymorphic bases 2531 and 2532 . Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis on DNA derived from 100 donors using the restriction enzyme Mae III showed that the Met ( 799 ) form of GPIa is restricted to Sit ( a ) ( + ) phenotype . Analysis of stable Chinese hamster ovary transfectants expressing allele-specific recombinant forms of GPIa showed that anti-Sit ( a ) exclusively reacted with the Glu ( 505 ) Met ( 799 ) , but not with the Glu ( 505 ) Thr ( 799 ) and the Lys ( 505 ) Thr ( 799 ) isoforms . In contrast , anti-Br ( a ) ( HPA-5b ) only recognized the Lys ( 505 ) Thr ( 799 ) form , whereas anti-Br ( b ) ( HPA-5a ) reacted with both Glu ( 505 ) Thr ( 799 ) and Glu ( 505 ) Met ( 799 ) isoforms . These results demonstrated that the Met ( 799 ) is responsible for formation of the Sit ( a ) alloantigenic determinants , whereas amino acid 505 ( Lys or Glu ) specifically controls the expression of Br ( a ) and Br ( b ) epitopes , respectively . Platelet aggregation responses of Sit ( a ) ( + ) individuals were diminished in response to collagen , indicating that the Thr ( 799 ) Met mutation affects the function of the GPIa / IIa complex;neurological
Confirmation of BRCA1 by analysis of germline mutations linked to breast and ovarian cancer in ten families.;We provide genetic evidence supporting the identity of the candidate gene for BRCA1 through the characterization of germline mutations in 63 breast cancer patients and 10 ovarian cancer patients in ten families with cancer linked to chromosome 17q21 . Nine different mutations were detected by screening BRCA1 DNA and RNA by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing . Seven mutations lead to protein truncations at sites throughout the gene . One missense mutation ( which occurred independently in two families ) leads to loss of a cysteine in the zinc binding domain . An intronic single basepair substitution destroys an acceptor site and activates a cryptic splice site , leading to a 59 basepair insertion and chain termination . The four families with both breast and ovarian cancer had chain termination mutations in the N-terminal half of the protein . .;oncological

Attenuated disruption of prepulse inhibition by dopaminergic stimulation after maternal deprivation and adolescent corticosterone treatment in rats.;The development of schizophrenia may include an early neurodevelopmental stress component which increases vulnerability to later stressful life events, in combination leading to overt disease. We investigated the effect of an early stress, in the form of maternal deprivation, combined with a later stress, simulated by chronic periadolescent corticosterone treatment, on behaviour in rats. Acute treatment with apomorphine caused disruption of prepulse inhibition (PPI) in controls and in rats that had undergone either maternal deprivation or corticosterone treatment, but was surprisingly absent in rats that had undergone the combined early and late stress. Amphetamine treatment significantly disrupted PPI in both non-deprived groups, but was absent in both maternally deprived groups. The serotonin-1A receptor agonist, 8-OH-DPAT, induced a significant disruption of PPI in all groups. Amphetamine-induced locomotor hyperactivity was similar in all groups. These results show an inhibitory interaction of early stress, caused by maternal deprivation, combined with 'adolescent' stress, simulated by corticosterone treatment, on dopaminergic regulation of PPI. The altered effects of apomorphine and amphetamine could indicate differential changes in dopamine receptor signalling leading to functional desensitisation, or altered modulation of sensory gating in the nucleus accumbens by limbic structures such as the hippocampus.;neurological
Delirium during fluoxetine treatment. A case report.;The correlation between high serum tricyclic antidepressant concentrations and central nervous system side effects has been well established. Only a few reports exist, however, on the relationship between the serum concentrations of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and their toxic effects. In some cases, a high serum concentration of citalopram (> 600 nmol/L) in elderly patients has been associated with increased somnolence and movement difficulties. Widespread cognitive disorders, such as delirium, have not been previously linked with high blood levels of SSRIs.

Omitting fentanyl reduces nausea and vomiting, without increasing pain, after sevoflurane for day surgery.;BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Despite advantages of induction and maintenance of anaesthesia with sevoflurane, postoperative nausea and vomiting occurs frequently. Fentanyl is a commonly used supplement that may contribute to this, although it may also improve analgesia. METHODS: This double-blind study examined the incidence and severity of postoperative nausea and vomiting and pain in the first 24 h after sevoflurane anaesthesia in 216 adult day surgery patients. Patients were randomly allocated to either receive or not receive 1 1 fentanyl, while a third group received dexamethasone in addition to fentanyl. RESULTS: Omission of fentanyl did not reduce the overall incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, but did reduce the incidence of vomiting and/or moderate to severe nausea prior to discharge from 20% and 17% with fentanyl and fentanyl-dexamethasone, respectively, to 5% (P = 0.013). Antiemetic requirements were reduced from 24% and 31% to 7% (P = 0.0012). Dexamethasone had no significant effect on the incidence or severity of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Combining the two fentanyl groups revealed further significant benefits from the avoidance of opioids, reducing postoperative nausea and vomiting and nausea prior to discharge from 35% and 33% to 22% and 19% (P = 0.049 and P = 0.035), respectively, while nausea in the first 24 h was decreased from 42% to 27% (P = 0.034). Pain severity and analgesic requirements were unaffected by the omission of fentanyl. Fentanyl did reduce minor intraoperative movement but had no sevoflurane-sparing effect and increased respiratory depression, hypotension and bradycardia. CONCLUSION: As fentanyl exacerbated postoperative nausea and vomiting without an improvement in postoperative pain and also had adverse cardiorespiratory effects, it appears to be an unnecessary and possibly detrimental supplement to sevoflurane in day surgery.;cardiovascular

Sulfate transport is not impaired in pendred syndrome thyrocytes.;Pendred syndrome is the most common form of syndromic deafness , characterized by dyshormonogenic goiter associated with sensory-neural deafness . The gene responsible for the disease ( PDS ) has been cloned , but its function is as yet unknown and the connection between thyroid goiter and sensory-neural deafness remains an enigma . PDS codes for a novel protein , pendrin , which is closely related to a number of sufate transporters . Mechanisms by which abnormal sulfate transport could deleteriously affect iodide organification have been proposed . We tested sulfate transport in thyrocytes obtained from Pendred syndrome patients and found that it was not defective . This suggests that pendrin in fact may not be a sulfate transporter , and emphasizes the importance of functional studies on this novel protein . .;neurological

Proteomic analysis of striatal proteins in the rat model of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia.;L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID) is among the motor complications that arise in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients after a prolonged treatment with L-DOPA. To this day, transcriptome analysis has been performed in a rat model of LID [Neurobiol. Dis., 17 (2004), 219] but information regarding the proteome is still lacking. In the present study, we investigated the changes occurring at the protein level in striatal samples obtained from the unilaterally 6-hydroxydopamine-lesion rat model of PD treated with saline, L-DOPA or bromocriptine using two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry (MS). Rats treated with L-DOPA were allocated to two groups based on the presence or absence of LID. Among the 2000 spots compared for statistical difference, 67 spots were significantly changed in abundance and identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight MS, atmospheric pressure matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization and HPLC coupled tandem MS (LC/MS/MS). Out of these 67 proteins, LID significantly changed the expression level of five proteins: alphabeta-crystalin, gamma-enolase, guanidoacetate methyltransferase, vinculin, and proteasome alpha-2 subunit. Complementary techniques such as western immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry were performed to investigate the validity of the data obtained using the proteomic approach. In conclusion, this study provides new insights into the protein changes occurring in LID.;neurological

Elevation of ADAM10, ADAM17, MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression with media degeneration features CaCl2-induced thoracic aortic aneurysm in a rat model.;PURPOSE: This study was designed to establish a rat model of thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) by calcium chloride (CaCl(2))-induced arterial injury and to explore the potential role of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their endogenous inhibitors (TIMPs) in TAA formation. METHODS: Thoracic aorta of male Sprague-Dawley rats was exposed to 0.5M CaCl(2) or normal saline (NaCl). After 12weeks, animals were euthanized, and CaCl(2)-treated, CaCl(2)-untreated (n=12) and NaCl-treated aortic segments (n=12) were collected for histological and molecular assessments. MMP-TIMP and ADAM mRNAs were semi-quantitatively analyzed and protein expressions were determined by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Despite similar external diameters among CaCl(2)-treated, non-CaCl(2)-treated and NaCl-treated segments, aneurymal alteration (n=6, 50%), media degeneration with regional disruption, fragmentation of elastic fiber, and increased collagen deposition (n=12, 100%) were demonstrated in CaCl(2)-treated segments. MMP-2, MMP-9, ADAM-10 and ADAM-17 mRNA levels were increased in CaCl(2)-treated segments (all p<0.01), with trends of elevation in CaCl(2)-untreated segments, as compared with NaCl-treated segments. Immunohistochemistry displayed significantly increased expressions of MMP-2, MMP-9, ADAM-10 and ADAM-17 (all p<0.01) in intima and media for CaCl(2)-treated segments. TIMP mRNA and tissue levels did not differ obviously among the three aortic segments. CONCLUSION: This study establishes a TAA model by periarterial CaCl(2) exposure in rats, and demonstrates a significant elevation of expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, ADAM10 and ADAM17 in the pathogenesis of vascular remodeling.;cardiovascular

This study suggests that administration of low doses of beta-blockers may improve levodopa-induced ballistic and choreic dyskinesia in PD.;neurological
Naloxone reverses the antihypertensive effect of clonidine.;In unanesthetized, spontaneously hypertensive rats the decrease in blood pressure and heart rate produced by intravenous clonidine, 5 to 20 micrograms/kg, was inhibited or reversed by nalozone, 0.2 to 2 mg/kg. The hypotensive effect of 100 mg/kg alpha-methyldopa was also partially reversed by naloxone. Naloxone alone did not affect either blood pressure or heart rate. In brain membranes from spontaneously hypertensive rats clonidine, 10(-8) to 10(-5) M, did not influence stereoselective binding of [3H]-naloxone (8 nM), and naloxone, 10(-8) to 10(-4) M, did not influence clonidine-suppressible binding of [3H]-dihydroergocryptine (1 nM). These findings indicate that in spontaneously hypertensive rats the effects of central alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation involve activation of opiate receptors. As naloxone and clonidine do not appear to interact with the same receptor site, the observed functional antagonism suggests the release of an endogenous opiate by clonidine or alpha-methyldopa and the possible role of the opiate in the central control of sympathetic tone.;neurological|cardiovascular

hCds1-mediated phosphorylation of BRCA1 regulates the DNA damage response.;Mutations in the BRCA1 ( ref . 1 ) tumour suppressor gene are found in almost all of the families with inherited breast and ovarian cancers and about half of the families with only breast cancer . Although the biochemical function of BRCA1 is not well understood , it is important for DNA damage repair and cell-cycle checkpoint . BRCA1 exists in nuclear foci but is hyperphosphorylated and disperses after DNA damage . It is not known whether BRCA1 phosphorylation and dispersion and its function in DNA damage response are related . In yeast the DNA damage response and the replication-block checkpoint are mediated partly through the Cds1 kinase family . Here we report that the human Cds1 kinase ( hCds1 / Chk2 ) regulates BRCA1 function after DNA damage by phosphorylating serine 988 of BRCA1 . We show that hCds1 and BRCA1 interact and co-localize within discrete nuclear foci but separate after gamma irradiation . Phosphorylation of BRCA1 at serine 988 is required for the release of BRCA1 from hCds1 . This phosphorylation is also important for the ability of BRCA1 to restore survival after DNA damage in the BRCA1-mutated cell line HCC1937 . .;oncological

Genetic mapping of the breast-ovarian cancer syndrome to a small interval on chromosome 17q12-21: exclusion of candidate genes EDH17B2 and RARA.;A susceptibility gene for hereditary breast-ovarian cancer , BRCA1 , has been assigned by linkage analysis to chromosome 17q21 . Candidate genes in this region include EDH17B2 , which encodes estradiol 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase II ( 17 beta-HSD II ) , and RARA , the gene for retinoic acid receptor alpha . We have typed 22 breast and breast-ovarian cancer families with eight polymorphisms from the chromosome 17q12-21 region , including two in the EDH17B2 gene . Genetic recombination with the breast cancer trait excludes RARA from further consideration as a candidate gene for BRCA1 . Both BRCA1 and EDH17B2 map to a 6 cM interval ( between THRA1 and D17S579 ) and no recombination was observed between the two genes . However , direct sequencing of overlapping PCR products containing the entire EDH17B2 gene in four unrelated affected women did not uncover any sequence variation , other than previously described polymorphisms . Mutations in the EDH17B2 gene , therefore do not appear to be responsible for the hereditary breast-ovarian cancer syndrome . Single meiotic crossovers in affected women suggest that BRCA1 is flanked by the loci RARA and D17S78 . .;neurological|oncological

Association of DRD2 polymorphisms and chlorpromazine-induced extrapyramidal syndrome in Chinese schizophrenic patients.;AIM: Extrapyramidal syndrome (EPS) is most commonly affected by typical antipsychotic drugs that have a high affinity with the D2 receptor. Recently, many research groups have reported on the positive relationship between the genetic variations in the DRD2 gene and the therapeutic response in schizophrenia patients as a result of the role of variations in the receptor in modulating receptor expression. In this study, we evaluate the role DRD2 plays in chlorpromazine-induced EPS in schizophrenic patients. METHODS: We identified seven SNP(single nucleotide polymorphism) (-141Cins>del, TaqIB, TaqID, Ser311Cys, rs6275, rs6277 and TaqIA) in the DRD2 gene in 146 schizophrenic inpatients (59 with EPS and 87 without EPS according to the Simpson-Angus Scale) treated with chlorpromazine after 8 weeks. The alleles of all loci were determined by PCR (polymerase chain reaction). RESULTS: Polymorphisms TaqID, Ser311Cys and rs6277 were not polymorphic in the population recruited in the present study. No statistical significance was found in the allele distribution of -141Cins>del, TaqIB, rs6275 and TaqIA or in the estimated haplotypes (constituted by TaqIB, rs6275 and TaqIA) in linkage disequilibrium between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Our results did not lend strong support to the view that the genetic variation of the DRD2 gene plays a major role in the individually variable adverse effect induced by chlorpromazine, at least in Chinese patients with schizophrenia. Our results confirmed a previous study on the relationship between DRD2 and EPS in Caucasians.;neurological
Fas preassociation required for apoptosis signaling and dominant inhibition by pathogenic mutations.;Heterozygous mutations encoding abnormal forms of the death receptor Fas dominantly interfere with Fas-induced lymphocyte apoptosis in human autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome . This effect , rather than depending on ligand-induced receptor oligomerization , was found to stem from ligand- independent interaction of wild-type and mutant Fas receptors through a specific region in the extracellular domain . Preassociated Fas complexes were found in living cells by means of fluorescence resonance energy transfer between variants of green fluorescent protein . These results show that formation of preassociated receptor complexes is necessary for Fas signaling and dominant interference in human disease . .;neurological

The amino acid sequence that is predicted from this portion of the DMD gene indicates that the protein product might serve a structural role in muscle , but the abundance and tissue distribution of the messenger RNA suggests that the DMD protein is not nebulin . .;neurological|cardiovascular
Exon 9 mutations in the WT1 gene, without influencing KTS splice isoforms, are also responsible for Frasier syndrome.;We report new mutations in exon 9 of the WT1 gene that did not alter the ratio of + / - KTS splice isoforms in two unrelated patients with Frasier syndrome ( FS ) . The mutation of intron 9 inducing defective alternative splicing was reported to be responsible for this syndrome . The mutations found in our cases occurred in the same exon of the WT1 gene as detected in Denys-Drash syndrome ( DDS ) and could not be explained by the previously proposed mechanism . The results suggest that the two syndromes originate from the same WT1 gene abnormality . From a molecular biological point of view , we concluded that the two diseases were not separable , and that FS should be included as an atypical form of DDS . .;neurological
All- trans-retinoic acid-induced erythema nodosum in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia.;Erythema nodosum associated with all- trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is very rare. We describe four patients with classic APL who developed erythema nodosum during ATRA therapy. Fever and subsequent multiple painful erythematous nodules over extremities developed on D11, D16, D17, and D19, respectively, after ATRA therapy. The skin biopsy taken from each patient was consistent with erythema nodosum. All patients received short course of steroids. Fever subsided rapidly and the skin lesions regressed completely. All patients achieved complete remission without withdrawal of ATRA. ATRA seemed to be the most possible etiology of erythema nodosum in our patients. Short-term use of steroid is very effective in ATRA-induced erythema nodosum.;oncological
Drug-Induced Acute Liver Injury Within 12 Hours After Fluvastatin Therapy.;Although statins are generally well-tolerated drugs, recent cases of drug-induced liver injury associated with their use have been reported. A 52-year-old Chinese man reported with liver damage, which appeared 12 hours after beginning treatment with fluvastatin. Patient presented with complaints of increasing nausea, anorexia, and upper abdominal pain. His laboratory values showed elevated creatine kinase and transaminases. Testing for autoantibodies was also negative. The liver biochemistries eventually normalized within 3 weeks of stopping the fluvastatin. Therefore, when prescribing statins, the possibility of hepatic damage should be taken into account.;hepatorenal

Water intoxication associated with oxytocin administration during saline-induced abortion.;Four cases of water intoxication in connection with oxytocin administration during saline-induced abortions are described. The mechanism of water intoxication is discussed in regard to these cases. Oxytocin administration during midtrimester-induced abortions is advocated only if it can be carried out under careful observations of an alert nursing staff, aware of the symptoms of water intoxication and instructed to watch the diuresis and report such early signs of the syndrome as asthenia, muscular irritability, or headaches. The oxytocin should be given only in Ringers lactate or, alternately, in Ringers lactate and a 5 per cent dextrose and water solutions. The urinary output should be monitored and the oxytocin administration discontinued and the serum electrolytes checked if the urinary output decreases. The oxytocin should not be administered in excess of 36 hours. If the patient has not aborted by then the oxytocin should be discontinued for 10 to 12 hours in order to perform electrolyte determinations and correct any electrolyte imbalance.;neurological

The negative mucosal potential: separating central and peripheral effects of NSAIDs in man.;"OBJECTIVE: We wanted to test whether assessment of both a central pain-related signal (chemo-somatosensory evoked potential, CSSEP) and a concomitantly recorded peripheral signal (negative mucosal potential, NMP) allows for separation of central and peripheral effects of NSAIDs. For this purpose, experimental conditions were created in which NSAIDs had previously been observed to produce effects on phasic and tonic pain by either central or peripheral mechanisms. METHODS: According to a double-blind, randomised, controlled, threefold cross-over design, 18 healthy subjects (11 males, 7 females; mean age 26 years) received either placebo, 400 mg ibuprofen, or 800 mg ibuprofen. Phasic pain was applied by means of short pulses of CO2 to the nasal mucosa (stimulus duration 500 ms, interval approximately 60 s), and tonic pain was induced in the nasal cavity by means of dry air of controlled temperature, humidity and flow rate (22 degrees C, 0% relative humidity, 145 ml.s-1). Both CSSEPs as central and NMPs as peripheral correlates of pain were obtained in response to the CO2 stimuli. Additionally, the subjects rated the intensity of both phasic and tonic pain by means of visual analogue scales. RESULTS: As described earlier, administration of ibuprofen was followed by a decrease in tonic pain but-relative to placebo-an increase in correlates of phasic pain, indicating a specific effect of ibuprofen on the interaction between the pain stimuli under these special experimental conditions. Based on the similar behaviour of CSSEP and NMP, it was concluded that the pharmacological process underlying this phenomenon was localised in the periphery. By means of the simultaneous recording of interrelated peripheral and central electrophysiologic correlates of nociception, it was possible to separate central and peripheral effects of an NSAID. The major advantage of this pain model is the possibility of obtaining peripheral pain-related activity directly using a non-invasive technique in humans.";neurological
Fatty liver induced by tetracycline in the rat. Dose-response relationships and effect of sex.;Dose-response relationships, biochemical mechanisms, and sex differences in the experimental fatty liver induced by tetracycline were studied in the intact rat and with the isolated perfused rat liver in vitro. In the intact male and female rat, no direct relationship was observed between dose of tetracycline and hepatic accumulation of triglyceride. With provision of adequate oleic acid as a substrate for the isolated perfused liver, a direct relationship was observed between dose of tetracycline and both accumulation of triglyceride in the liver and depression of output of triglyceride by livers from male and female rats. Marked differences were observed between female and male rats with regard to base line (control) hepatic concentration of triglyceride and output of triglyceride. Accumulation of hepatic triglyceride, as a per cent of control values, in response to graded doses of tetracycline, did not differ significantly between male, female and pregnant rat livers. However, livers from female, and especially pregnant female rats, were strikingly resistant to the effects of tetracycline on depression of output of triglyceride under these experimental conditions. These differences between the sexes could not be related to altered disposition of tetracycline or altered uptake of oleic acid. Depressed hepatic secretion of triglyceride accounted only for 30 to 50% of accumulated hepatic triglyceride, indicating that additional mechanisms must be involved in the production of the triglyceride-rich fatty liver in response to tetracycline.;neurological|hepatorenal
von Willebrand disease type B: a missense mutation selectively abolishes ristocetin-induced von Willebrand factor binding to platelet glycoprotein Ib.;von Willebrand factor ( vWF ) is a multimeric glycoprotein that mediates the adhesion of platelets to the subendothelium by binding to platelet glycoprotein Ib . For human vWF , this interaction can be induced in vitro by the antibiotic ristocetin or the snake venom protein botrocetin . A missense mutation , Gly-561-- > Ser , was identified within the proposed glycoprotein Ib binding domain of vWF in the proband with von Willebrand disease type B , a unique variant characterized by no ristocetin-induced , but normal botrocetin-induced , binding to glycoprotein Ib . The corresponding mutant recombinant protein , rvWF ( G561S ) , formed normal multimers and exhibited the same functional defect as the patients plasma vWF , confirming that this mutation causes von Willebrand disease type B . These data show that botrocetin and ristocetin cofactor activities of vWF can be dissociated by a point mutation and confirm that these mediators promote vWF binding to platelets by different mechanisms . The normal botrocetin-induced binding and the defective ristocetin-induced binding of rvWF ( G561S ) suggest that the primary defect in von Willebrand disease type B may be a failure of normal allosteric regulation of the glycoprotein Ib binding function of vWF . .;neurological

Myocardial Fas ligand expression increases susceptibility to AZT-induced cardiomyopathy.;"BACKGROUND: Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and myocarditis occur in many HIV-infected individuals, resulting in symptomatic heart failure in up to 5% of patients. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has significantly reduced morbidity and mortality of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), but has resulted in an increase in cardiac and skeletal myopathies. METHODS AND RESULTS: In order to investigate whether the HAART component zidovudine (3'-azido-2',3'-deoxythymidine; AZT) triggers the Fas-dependent cell-death pathway and cause cytoskeletal disruption in a murine model of DCM, 8-week-old transgenic (expressing Fas ligand in the myocardium: FasL Tg) and non-transgenic (NTg) mice received water ad libitum containing different concentrations of AZT (0, 0.07, 0.2, and 0.7 mg/ml). After 6 weeks, cardiac function was assessed by echocardiography and morphology was assessed by histopathologic and immunohistochemical methods. NTg and untreated FasL Tg mice showed little or no change in cardiac structure or function. In contrast, AZT-treated FasL Tg mice developed cardiac dilation and depressed cardiac function in a dose-dependent manner, with concomitant inflammatory infiltration of both ventricles. These changes were associated with an increased sarcolemmal expression of Fas and FasL, as well as increased activation of caspase 3, translocation of calpain 1 to the sarcolemma and sarcomere, and increased numbers of cells undergoing apoptosis. These were associated with changes in dystrophin and cardiac troponin I localization, as well as loss of sarcolemmal integrity. CONCLUSIONS: The expression of Fas ligand in the myocardium, as identified in HIV-positive patients, might increase the susceptibility to HAART-induced cardiomyopathy due to activation of apoptotic pathways, resulting in cardiac dilation and dysfunction.";cardiovascular
Noradrenergic involvement in catalepsy induced by delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol.;In order to elucidate the role of the catecholaminergic system in the cataleptogenic effect of delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the effect of pretreatment with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) or with desipramine and 6-OHDA and lesions of the locus coeruleus were investigated in rats. The cataleptogenic effect of THC was significantly reduced in rats treated with 6-OHDA and in rats with lesions of the locus coeruleus but not in rats treated with desipramine and 6-OHDA, as compared with control rats. On the contrary, the cataleptogenic effect of haloperidol was significantly reduced in rats treated with desipramine and 6-OHDA but not in rats treated with 6-OHDA or in rats with lesions of the locus coeruleus. These results indicate that noradrenergic neurons have an important role in the manifestation of catalepsy induced by THC, whereas dopaminergic neurons are important in catalepsy induced by haloperidol.;neurological

A metoprolol-terbinafine combination induced bradycardia.;To report a sinus bradycardia induced by metoprolol and terbinafine drug-drug interaction and its management. A 63 year-old Caucasian man on metoprolol 200 mg/day for stable coronary artery disease was prescribed a 90-day course of oral terbinafine 250 mg/day for onychomycosis. On the 49th day of terbinafine therapy, he was brought to the emergency room for a decrease of his global health status, confusion and falls. The electrocardiogram revealed a 37 beats/min sinus bradycardia. A score of 7 on the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale indicates a probable relationship between the patient's sinus bradycardia and the drug interaction between metoprolol and terbinafine. The heart rate ameliorated first with a decrease in the dose of metoprolol. It was subsequently changed to bisoprolol and the heart rate remained normal. By inhibiting the cytochrome P450 2D6, terbinafine had decreased metoprolol's clearance, leading in metoprolol accumulation which has resulted in clinically significant sinus bradycardia.;cardiovascular

The gene for familial Mediterranean fever, MEFV, is expressed in early leukocyte development and is regulated in response to inflammatory mediators.;Familial Mediterranean fever ( FMF ) is a recessive disorder characterized by episodes of fever and neutrophil-mediated serosal inflammation . We recently identified the gene causing FMF , designated MEFV , and found it to be expressed in mature neutrophils , suggesting that it functions as an inflammatory regulator . To facilitate our understanding of the normal function of MEFV , we extended our previous studies . MEFV messenger RNA was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in bone marrow leukocytes , with differential expression observed among cells by in situ hybridization . CD34 hematopoietic stem-cell cultures induced toward the granulocytic lineage expressed MEFV at the myelocyte stage , concurrently with lineage commitment . The prepromyelocytic cell line HL60 expressed MEFV only at granulocytic and monocytic differentiation . MEFV was also expressed in the monocytic cell lines U937 and THP-1 . Among peripheral blood leukocytes , MEFV expression was detected in neutrophils , eosinophils , and to varying degrees , monocytes . Consistent with the tissue specificity of expression , complete sequencing and analysis of upstream regulatory regions of MEFV revealed homology to myeloid-specific promoters and to more broadly expressed inflammatory promoter elements . In vitro stimulation of monocytes with the proinflammatory agents interferon ( IFN ) gamma , tumor necrosis factor , and lipopolysaccharide induced MEFV expression , whereas the antiinflammatory cytokines interleukin ( IL ) 4 , IL-10 , and transforming growth factor beta inhibited such expression . Induction by IFN-gamma occurred rapidly and was resistant to cycloheximide . IFN-alpha also induced MEFV expression . In granulocytes , MEFV was up-regulated by IFN-gamma and the combination of IFN-alpha and colchicine . These results refine understanding of MEFV by placing the gene in the myelomonocytic-specific proinflammatory pathway and identifying it as an IFN-gamma immediate early gene . .;oncological

Long-term effects of vincristine on the peripheral nervous system.;Forty patients with Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma treated with vincristine between 1984 and 1990 (cumulative dose 12 mg in 18-24 weeks) were investigated in order to evaluate the long term effects of vincristine on the peripheral nervous system. The patients were interviewed with emphasis on neuropathic symptoms. Physical and quantitative sensory examination with determination of vibratory perception and thermal discrimination thresholds were performed, four to 77 months (median 34 months) after vincristine treatment. Twenty-seven patients reported neuropathic symptoms. In 13 of these 27 patients symptoms were still present at the time of examination. In these patients sensory signs and symptoms predominated. In the other 14 patients symptoms had been present in the past. Symptoms persisted maximally 40 months since cessation of therapy. There was no age difference between patients with and without complaints at the time of examination. Normal reflexes were found in two third of patients. Neuropathic complaints were not very troublesome on the long term. It is concluded that with the above mentioned vincristine dose schedule signs and symptoms of vincristine neuropathy are reversible for a great deal and prognosis is fairly good.;neurological|oncological
A potential animal model for Lesch-Nyhan syndrome through introduction of HPRT mutations into mice.;The human Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is a rare neurological and behavioural disorder , affecting only males , which is caused by an inherited deficiency in the level of activity of the purine salvage enzyme hypoxanthine-guanosine phosphoribosyl transferase ( HPRT ) . How the resulting alterations in purine metabolism lead to the severe symptoms characteristic of Lesch-Nyhan patients is still not understood . No mutations at the Hprt locus leading to loss of activity have been described in laboratory animals . To derive an animal model for the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome , we have used cultured mouse embryonic stem cells , mutagenized by retroviral insertion and selected for loss of HPRT activity , to construct chimaeric mice . Two clonal lines carrying different mutant Hprt alleles have given rise to germ cells in chimaeras , allowing the derivation of strains of mutant mice having the same biochemical defect as Lesch-Nyhan patients . Male mice carrying the mutant alleles are viable and analysis of their cells shows a total lack of HPRT activity . .;neurological
Mesangial function and glomerular sclerosis in rats with aminonucleoside nephrosis.;"The possible relationship between mesangial dysfunction and development of glomerular sclerosis was studied in the puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) model. Five male Wistar rats received repeated subcutaneous PAN injections; five controls received saline only. After 4 weeks the PAN rats were severely proteinuric (190 +/- 80 mg/24 hr), and all rats were given colloidal carbon (CC) intravenously. At 5 months glomerular sclerosis was found in 7.6 +/- 3.4% of the glomeruli of PAN rats; glomeruli of the controls were normal. Glomeruli of PAN rats contained significantly more CC than glomeruli of controls. Glomeruli with sclerosis contained significantly more CC than non-sclerotic glomeruli in the same kidneys. CC was preferentially localized within the sclerotic areas of the affected glomeruli. Since mesangial CC clearance from the mesangium did not change during chronic PAN treatment, we conclude that this preferential CC localization within the lesions is caused by an increased CC uptake shortly after injection in apparent vulnerable areas where sclerosis will develop subsequently. Cluster analysis showed a random distribution of lesions in the PAN glomeruli in concordance with the random localization of mesangial areas with dysfunction in this model. Similar to the remnant kidney model in PAN nephrosis the development of glomerular sclerosis may be related to ""mesangial overloading.""";hepatorenal
Evidence for a cholinergic role in haloperidol-induced catalepsy.;Experiments in mice tested previous evidence that activation of cholinergic systems promotes catalepsy and that cholinergic mechanisms need to be intact for full expression of neuroleptic-induced catalepsy. Large doses of the cholinomimetic, pilocarpine, could induce catalepsy when peripheral cholinergic receptors were blocked. Low doses of pilocarpine caused a pronounced enhancement of the catalepsy that was induced by the dopaminergic blocker, haloperidol. A muscarinic receptor blocker, atropine, disrupted haloperidol-induced catalepsy. Intracranial injection of an acetylcholine-synthesis inhibitor, hemicholinium, prevented the catalepsy that is usually induced by haloperidol. These findings suggest the hypothesis that the catalepsy that is produced by neuroleptics such as haloperidol is actually mediated by intrinsic central cholinergic systems. Alternatively, activation of central cholinergic systems could promote catalepsy by suppression of dopaminergic systems.;neurological

Mild and severe muscular dystrophy associated with deletions in Xp21 of the human X chromosome.;We have analysed over 300 patients suffering from Duchenne or Becker muscular dystrophy ( DMD or BMD ) . Deletions have been characterised which encompass either the pERT87 ( DXS164 ) locus only , the XJ1 . 1 ( DXS206 ) and HIP25 loci only , or all three loci . These loci have been shown to lie within the DMD region covering several hundred kilobases ( kb ) of DNA . One mildly affected BMD patient possesses a deletion of at least 110 kb including exons of the DMD gene . Other patients with similar exon deletions , or smaller deletions , show the more severe phenotype typical of DMD . We conclude from these studies that the severity of the clinical phenotype cannot be explained on the basis of the size of the deletion . We discuss this in the context of candidate gene sequences .;neurological
Iron-dependent self-assembly of recombinant yeast frataxin: implications for Friedreich ataxia.;Frataxin deficiency is the primary cause of Friedreich ataxia ( FRDA ) , an autosomal recessive cardiodegenerative and neurodegenerative disease . Frataxin is a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial protein that is widely conserved among eukaryotes . Genetic inactivation of the yeast frataxin homologue ( Yfh1p ) results in mitochondrial iron accumulation and hypersensitivity to oxidative stress . Increased iron deposition and evidence of oxidative damage have also been observed in cardiac tissue and cultured fibroblasts from patients with FRDA . These findings indicate that frataxin is essential for mitochondrial iron homeostasis and protection from iron-induced formation of free radicals . The functional mechanism of frataxin , however , is still unknown . We have expressed the mature form of Yfh1p ( mYfh1p ) in Escherichia coli and have analyzed its function in vitro . Isolated mYfh1p is a soluble monomer ( 13 , 783 Da ) that contains no iron and shows no significant tendency to self-associate . Aerobic addition of ferrous iron to mYfh1p results in assembly of regular spherical multimers with a molecular mass of approximately 1 . 1 MDa ( megadaltons ) and a diameter of 13 + / -2 nm . Each multimer consists of approximately 60 subunits and can sequester > 3 , 000 atoms of iron . Titration of mYfh1p with increasing iron concentrations supports a stepwise mechanism of multimer assembly . Sequential addition of an iron chelator and a reducing agent results in quantitative iron release with concomitant disassembly of the multimer , indicating that mYfh1p sequesters iron in an available form . In yeast mitochondria , native mYfh1p exists as monomer and a higher-order species with a molecular weight > 600 , 000 . After addition of ( 55 ) Fe to the medium , immunoprecipitates of this species contain > 16 atoms of ( 55 ) Fe per molecule of mYfh1p . We propose that iron-dependent self-assembly of recombinant mYfh1p reflects a physiological role for frataxin in mitochondrial iron sequestration and bioavailability . .;neurological|cardiovascular
Analysis of alkaptonuria (AKU) mutations and polymorphisms reveals that the CCC sequence motif is a mutational hot spot in the homogentisate 1,2 dioxygenase gene (HGO).;"We recently showed that alkaptonuria ( AKU ) is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the homogentisate 1 , 2 dioxygenase gene ( HGO ) . Herein we describe haplotype and mutational analyses of HGO in seven new AKU pedigrees . These analyses identified two novel single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( INV4 + 31A-- > G and INV11 + 18A-- > G ) and six novel AKU mutations ( INV1-1G-- > A , W60G , Y62C , A122D , P230T , and D291E ) , which further illustrates the remarkable allelic heterogeneity found in AKU . Reexamination of all 29 mutations and polymorphisms thus far described in HGO shows that these nucleotide changes are not randomly distributed ; the CCC sequence motif and its inverted complement , GGG , are preferentially mutated . These analyses also demonstrated that the nucleotide substitutions in HGO do not involve CpG dinucleotides , which illustrates important differences between HGO and other genes for the occurrence of mutation at specific short-sequence motifs . Because the CCC sequence motifs comprise a significant proportion ( 34 . 5 % ) of all mutated bases that have been observed in HGO , we conclude that the CCC triplet is a mutational hot spot in HGO .";neurological
Arterial thromboembolism in patients receiving systemic heparin therapy: a complication associated with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.;Arterial thromboembolism is a recognized complication of systemic heparin therapy. Characteristic of the entity is arterial occlusion by platelet-fibrin thrombi with distal ischemia occurring four to twenty days after the initiation of heparin therapy, preceded by profound thrombocytopenia with platelet counts in the range of 30,000 to 40,000 per cubic millimeter. The clinically apparent occlusion may be preceded by gastrointestinal and musculoskeletal symptoms that appear to be ischemic in origin, and might serve to warn the clinician of these complications. Previous reports of these phenomena as well as recent studies of the effect of heparin are reviewed. The common factor relating thromboembolism and thrombocytopenia is heparin-induced platelet aggregation. Appropriate treatment consists of discontinuation of heparin, and anticoagulation with sodium warfarin if necessary. Vascular procedures are performed as indicated.;neurological
Cocaine, ethanol, and cocaethylene cardiotoxity in an animal model of cocaine and ethanol abuse.;"OBJECTIVES: Simultaneous abuse of cocaine and ethanol affects 12 million Americans annually. In combination, these substances are substantially more toxic than either drug alone. Their combined cardiac toxicity may be due to independent effects of each drug; however, they may also be due to cocaethylene (CE), a cocaine metabolite formed only in the presence of ethanol. The purpose of this study was to delineate the role of CE in the combined cardiotoxicity of cocaine and ethanol in a model simulating their abuse. METHODS: Twenty-three dogs were randomized to receive either 1) three intravenous (IV) boluses of cocaine 7.5 mg/kg with ethanol (1 g/kg) as an IV infusion (C+E, n = 8), 2) three cocaine boluses only (C, n = 6), 3) ethanol infusion only (E, n = 5), or 4) placebo boluses and infusion (n = 4). Hemodynamic measurements, electrocardiograms, and serum drug concentrations were obtained at baseline, and then at fixed time intervals after each drug was administered. RESULTS: Two of eight dogs in the C+E group experienced cardiovascular collapse. The most dramatic hemodynamic changes occurred after each cocaine bolus in the C+E and C only groups; however, persistent hemodynamic changes occurred in the C+E group. Peak CE levels were associated with a 45% (SD +/- 22%, 95% CI = 22% to 69%) decrease in cardiac output (p < 0.05), a 56% (SD +/- 23%, 95% CI = 32% to 80%) decrease in dP/dt(max) (p <.006), and a 23% (SD +/- 15%, 95% CI = 7% to 49%) decrease in SVO(2) (p < 0.025). Ventricular arrhythmias were primarily observed in the C+E group, in which four of eight dogs experienced ventricular tachycardia. CONCLUSIONS: Cocaine and ethanol in combination were more toxic than either substance alone. Co-administration resulted in prolonged cardiac toxicity and was dysrhythmogenic. Peak serum cocaethylene concentrations were associated with prolonged myocardial depression.";neurological|cardiovascular

Safety and adverse effects associated with raloxifene: multiple outcomes of raloxifene evaluation.;"OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of raloxifene on major adverse events that occur with postmenopausal estrogen therapy or tamoxifen. METHODS: The Multiple Outcomes of Raloxifene Evaluation, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial, enrolled 7,705 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Women were randomly assigned to raloxifene 60 mg/d or 120 mg/d or placebo. Outcomes included venous thromboembolism, cataracts, gallbladder disease, and endometrial hyperplasia or cancer. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 3.3 years, raloxifene was associated with an increased risk for venous thromboembolism (relative risk [RR] 2.1; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-3.8). The excess event rate was 1.8 per 1,000 woman-years (95% CI -0.5-4.1), and the number needed to treat to cause 1 event was 170 (95% CI 100-582) over 3.3 years. Risk in the raloxifene group was higher than in the placebo group for the first 2 years, but decreased to about the same rate as in the placebo group thereafter. Raloxifene did not increase risk for cataracts (RR 0.9; 95% CI 0.8-1.1), gallbladder disease (RR 1.0; 95% CI 0.7-1.3), endometrial hyperplasia (RR 1.3; 95% CI 0.4-5.1), or endometrial cancer (RR 0.9; 95% CI 0.3-2.7). CONCLUSION: Raloxifene was associated with an increased risk for venous thromboembolism, but there was no increased risk for cataracts, gallbladder disease, endometrial hyperplasia, or endometrial cancer.

Cerebral vasculitis following oral methylphenidate intake in an adult: a case report.;Methylphenidate is structurally and functionally similar to amphetamine. Cerebral vasculitis associated with amphetamine abuse is well documented, and in rare cases ischaemic stroke has been reported after methylphenidate intake in children. We report the case of a 63-year-old female who was treated with methylphenidate due to hyperactivity and suffered from multiple ischaemic strokes. We consider drug-induced cerebral vasculitis as the most likely cause of recurrent ischaemic strokes in the absence of any pathological findings during the diagnostic work-up. We conclude that methylphenidate mediated vasculitis should be considered in patients with neurological symptoms and a history of methylphenidate therapy. This potential side-effect, though very rare, represents one more reason to be very restrictive in the use of methylphenidate.;neurological

Genotype and phenotype in patients with dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency .;Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase ( DPD ) deficiency is an autosomal recessive disease characterised by thymine-uraciluria in homozygous deficient patients and has been associated with a variable clinical phenotype . In order to understand the genetic and phenotypic basis for DPD deficiency , we have reviewed 17 families presenting 22 patients with complete deficiency of DPD . In this group of patients , 7 different mutations have been identified , including 2 deletions [ 295-298delTCAT , 1897delC ] , 1 splice-site mutation [ IVS14 + 1G > A ) ] and 4 missense mutations ( 85T > C , 703C > T , 2658G > A , 2983G > T ) . Analysis of the prevalence of the various mutations among DPD patients has shown that the G-- > A point mutation in the invariant splice donor site is by far the most common ( 52 % ) , whereas the other six mutations are less frequently observed . A large phenotypic variability has been observed , with convulsive disorders , motor retardation and mental retardation being the most abundant manifestations . A clear correlation between the genotype and phenotype has not been established . An altered beta-alanine , uracil and thymine homeostasis might underlie the various clinical abnormalities encountered in patients with DPD deficiency .;neurological|hepatorenal

Pharmacological evidence for the potential of Daucus carota in the management of cognitive dysfunctions.;The present study was aimed at investigating the effects of Daucus carota seeds on cognitive functions, total serum cholesterol levels and brain cholinesterase activity in mice. The ethanolic extract of Daucus carota seeds (DCE) was administered orally in three doses (100, 200, 400 mg/kg) for seven successive days to different groups of young and aged mice. Elevated plus maze and passive avoidance apparatus served as the exteroceptive behavioral models for testing memory. Diazepam-, scopolamine- and ageing-induced amnesia served as the interoceptive behavioral models. DCE (200, 400 mg/kg, p.o.) showed significant improvement in memory scores of young and aged mice. The extent of memory improvement evoked by DCE was 23% at the dose of 200 mg/kg and 35% at the dose of 400 mg/kg in young mice using elevated plus maze. Similarly, significant improvements in memory scores were observed using passive avoidance apparatus and aged mice. Furthermore, DCE reversed the amnesia induced by scopolamine (0.4 mg/kg, i.p.) and diazepam (1 mg/kg, i.p.). Daucus carota extract (200, 400 mg/kg, p.o.) reduced significantly the brain acetylcholinesterase activity and cholesterol levels in young and aged mice. The extent of inhibition of brain cholinesterase activity evoked by DCE at the dose of 400 mg/kg was 22% in young and 19% in aged mice. There was a remarkable reduction in total cholesterol level as well, to the extent of 23% in young and 21% in aged animals with this dose of DCE. Therefore, DCE may prove to be a useful remedy for the management of cognitive dysfunctions on account of its multifarious beneficial effects such as, memory improving property, cholesterol lowering property and anticholinesterase activity.;neurological
"""Real-world"" data on the efficacy and safety of lenalidomide and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma who were treated according to the standard clinical practice: a study of the Greek Myeloma Study Group.";"Lenalidomide and dexamethasone (RD) is a standard of care for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM), but there is limited published data on its efficacy and safety in the ""real world"" (RW), according to the International Society of Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research definition. We studied 212 RRMM patients who received RD in RW. Objective response (>PR (partial response)) rate was 77.4 % (complete response (CR), 20.2 %). Median time to first and best response was 2 and 5 months, respectively. Median time to CR when RD was given as 2nd or >2(nd)-line treatment at 4 and 11 months, respectively. Quality of response was independent of previous lines of therapies or previous exposure to thalidomide or bortezomib. Median duration of response was 34.4 months, and it was higher in patients who received RD until progression (not reached versus 19 months, p < 0.001). Improvement of humoral immunity occurred in 60 % of responders (p < 0.001) and in the majority of patients who achieved stable disease. Adverse events were reported in 68.9 % of patients (myelosuppression in 49.4 %) and 12.7 % of patients needed hospitalization. Peripheral neuropathy was observed only in 2.5 % of patients and deep vein thrombosis in 5.7 %. Dose reductions were needed in 31 % of patients and permanent discontinuation in 38.9 %. Median time to treatment discontinuation was 16.8 months. Performance status (PS) and initial lenalidomide dose predicted for treatment discontinuation. Extra-medullary relapses occurred in 3.8 % of patients. Our study confirms that RD is effective and safe in RRMM in the RW; it produces durable responses especially in patients who continue on treatment till progression and improves humoral immunity even in patients with stable disease.";neurological

Enhanced stimulus-induced neurotransmitter overflow in epinephrine-induced hypertensive rats is not mediated by prejunctional beta-adrenoceptor activation.;The present study examines the effect of 6-day epinephrine treatment (100 micrograms/kg per h, s.c.) on stimulus-induced (1 Hz) endogenous neurotransmitter overflow from the isolated perfused kidney of vehicle- and epinephrine-treated rats. Renal catecholamine stores and stimulus-induced overflow in the vehicle-treated group consisted of norepinephrine only. However, epinephrine treatment resulted in the incorporation of epinephrine into renal catecholamine stores such that approximately 40% of the catecholamine present was epinephrine while the norepinephrine content was reduced by a similar degree. Total tissue catecholamine content of the kidney on a molar basis was unchanged. Stimulus-induced fractional overflow of neurotransmitter from the epinephrine-treated kidneys was approximately twice normal and consisted of both norepinephrine and epinephrine in proportions similar to those found in the kidney. This difference in fractional overflow between groups was not affected by neuronal and extraneuronal uptake blockade. Propranolol had no effect on stimulus-induced overflow in either group. Phentolamine increased stimulus-induced overflow in both groups although the increment in overflow was greater in the epinephrine-treated group. In conclusion, chronic epinephrine treatment results in enhanced fractional neurotransmitter overflow. However, neither alterations in prejunctional beta-adrenoceptor influences nor alterations in neuronal and extraneuronal uptake mechanisms appear to be responsible for this alteration. Furthermore, data obtained with phentolamine alone do not suggest alpha-adrenoceptor desensitization as the cause of the enhanced neurotransmitter overflow after epinephrine treatment.;neurological|hepatorenal

Metabotropic glutamate 7 receptor subtype modulates motor symptoms in rodent models of Parkinson's disease.;Metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors modulate synaptic transmission in the central nervous system and represent promising therapeutic targets for symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). Among the eight mGlu receptor subtypes, mGlu7 receptor is prominently expressed in the basal ganglia, but its role in restoring motor function in animal models of PD is not known. The effects of N,N'-dibenzhydrylethane-1,2-diamine dihydrochloride (AMN082), the first selective allosteric activator of mGlu7 receptors, were thus tested in different rodent models of PD. Here, we show that oral (5 mg/kg) or intrastriatal administration (0.1 and 0.5 nmol) of AMN082 reverses haloperidol-induced catalepsy in rats. AMN082 (2.5 and 5 mg/kg) reduces apomorphine-induced rotations in unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned rats. In a more complex task commonly used to evaluate major akinetic symptoms of PD patients, 5 mg/kg AMN082 reverses the increased reaction time to respond to a cue of bilateral 6-OHDA-lesioned rats. In addition, AMN082 reduces the duration of haloperidol-induced catalepsy in a mGlu7 receptor-dependent manner in wild-type but not mGlu7 receptor knockout mice. Higher doses of AMN082 (10 and 20 mg/kg p.o.) have no effect on the same models of PD. Overall these findings suggest that mGlu7 receptor activation can reverse motor dysfunction associated with reduced dopamine activity. Selective ligands of mGlu7 receptor subtypes may thus be considered as promising compounds for the development of antiparkinsonian therapeutic strategies.;neurological

Combined analysis of hereditary prostate cancer linkage to 1q24-25: results from 772 hereditary prostate cancer families from the International Consortium for Prostate Cancer Genetics.;A previous linkage study provided evidence for a prostate cancer-susceptibility locus at 1q24-25 . Subsequent reports in additional collections of families have yielded conflicting results . In addition , evidence for locus heterogeneity has been provided by the identification of other putative hereditary prostate cancer loci on Xq27-28 , 1q42-43 , and 1p36 . The present study describes a combined analysis for six markers in the 1q24-25 region in 772 families affected by hereditary prostate cancer and ascertained by the members of the International Consortium for Prostate Cancer Genetics ( ICPCG ) from North America , Australia , Finland , Norway , Sweden , and the United Kingdom . Overall , there was some evidence for linkage , with a peak parametric multipoint LOD score assuming heterogeneity ( HLOD ) of 1 . 40 ( P = . 01 ) at D1S212 . The estimated proportion of families ( alpha ) linked to the locus was . 06 ( 1-LOD support interval . 01- . 12 ) . This evidence was not observed by a nonparametric approach , presumably because of the extensive heterogeneity . Further parametric analysis revealed a significant effect of the presence of male-to-male disease transmission within the families . In the subset of 491 such families , the peak HLOD was 2 . In the subset of 491 such families , the peak HLOD was 2 . 56 ( P = . 0006 ) and alpha = . 11 ( 1-LOD support interval . 04- . 19 ) , compared with HLODs of 0 in the remaining 281 families . Within the families with male-to-male disease transmission , alpha increased with the early mean age at diagnosis ( prostate cancer-susceptibility gene linked to 1q24-25 , albeit in a defined subset of prostate cancer families . Although HPC1 accounts for only a small proportion of all families affected by hereditary prostate cancer , it appears to play a more prominent role in the subset of families with several members affected at an early age and with male-to-male disease transmission .;oncological

Modification of drug action by hyperammonemia.;Pretreatment with ammonium acetate (NH4Ac) (6 mmol/kg s.c.) approximately doubled the time morphine-treated mice remained on a hot surface and similarly increased muscular incoordination by diazepam, but NH4Ac treatment alone had no effect. Thus, hyperammonemia is capable of altering drug action and must be considered along with impaired drug metabolism in enhanced drug responses associated with liver disease. Experiments in vitro showed that acetylcholine-induced catecholamine release from bovine adrenal medulla is depressed as much as 50% by 0.3 mM NH4Ac and KCl-induced contractions of guinea-pig ileum were inhibited 20% by 5 mM NH4Ac. Addition of excess calcium reversed the depression in both tissues, but calcium-independent catecholamine release by acetaldehyde was not blocked by NH4Ac. These results suggested that ammonia blocks calcium channels. Parallels in the actions of NH4Ac and the calcium channel blocker verapamil support this concept. Both verapamil (10 mg/kg i.p.) and NH4Ac pretreatment enhanced morphine analgesia- and diazepam-induced muscular incoordination and antagonized amphetamine-induced motor activity, and neither verapamil nor NH4Ac affected the convulsant action of metrazol. The data suggest that hyperammonemia exerts a calcium channel blocking action which enhances the effects of central nervous system depressants and certain opioid analgesics.;hepatorenal
Novel mutations of the ATP7B gene in Japanese patients with Wilson disease.;Wilson disease ( WD ) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by copper accumulation in the liver , brain , kidneys , and corneas , and culminating in copper toxication in these organs . In this study , we analyzed mutations of the responsible gene , ATP7B , in four Japanese patients with WD . By direct sequencing , we identified five mutations , of which two were novel , and 16 polymorphisms , of which 6 were novel . The mutations 2871delC and 2513delA shift the reading frame so that truncated abnormal protein is expected . In contrast to these mutations found in patients with hepatic-type of early onset , the mutations A874V , R778L , and 3892delGTC were either missense mutations or in frame 1-amino acid deletion , and occurred in the patients with hepato-neurologic type of late onset . The mutations 2871delC and R778L have been previously reported in a relatively large number of Japanese patients . In particular , R778L is known to be more prevalent in Asian countries than in other countries of the world . Our data are compatible with the hypothesis that the mutations tend to occur in a population-specific manner . Therefore , the accumulation of the types of mutations in Japanese patients with WD will facilitate the fast and effective genetic diagnosis of WD in Japanese patients . .;neurological|hepatorenal

Molecular and phenotypic analysis of patients with deletions within the deletion-rich region of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) gene.;"Eighty unrelated individuals with Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD )or Becker muscular dystrophy ( BMD ) were found to have deletions in the major deletion-rich region of the DMD locus . This region includes the last five exons detected by cDNA5b-7 , all exons detected by cDNA8 , and the first two exons detected by cDNA9 . These 80 individuals account for approximately 75 % of 109 deletions of the gene , detected among 181 patients analyzed with the entire dystrophin cDNA . Endpoints for many of these deletions were further characterized using two genomic probes , p20 ( DXS269 ; Wapenaar et al . ) and GMGX11 ( DXS239 ; present paper ) . Clinical findings are presented for all 80 patients allowing a correlation of phenotypic severity with the genotype . Thirty-eight independent patients were old enough to be classified as DMD , BMD , or intermediate phenotype and had deletions of exons with sequenced intron / exon boundaries . Of these , eight BMD patients and one intermediate patient had gene deletions predicted to leave the reading frame intact , while 21 DMD patients , 7 intermediate patients , and 1 BMD patient had gene deletions predicted to disrupt the reading frame . Thus , with two exceptions , frameshift deletions of the gene resulted in more severe phenotype than did in-frame deletions . This is in agreement with recent findings by Baumbach et al . and Koenig et al . but is in contrast to findings , by Malhotra et al . at the 5 ' end of the gene .";neurological

Ocular manifestations of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.;"We followed 210 cases of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis closely for eleven years. Thirty-six of the 210 patients (17.2%) developed iridocyclitis. Iridocyclitis was seen most frequently in young female patients (0 to 4 years) with the monoarticular or pauciatricular form of the arthritis. However, 30% of the patients developed uveitis after 16 years of age. Although 61% of patients had a noncontributory ocular history on entry, 42% had active uveitis on entry. Our approach was effective in detecting uveitis in new cases and exacerbations of uveitis in established cases. Forty-four percent of patients with uveitis had one or more identifiable signs or symptoms, such as red eye, ocular pain, decreased visual acuity, or photophobia, in order of decreasing frequency. Even after early detection and prompt treatment, 41% of cases of uveitis did not respond to more than six months of intensive topical treatment with corticosteroids and mydriatics. Despite this, there was a dramatic decrease in the 50% incidence of blinding complications of uveitis cited in earlier studies. Cataract and band keratopathy occurred in only 22 and 13% of our group, respectively. We used chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in 173 of 210 cases and found only one case of chorioretinopathy attributable to these drugs. Systemically administered corticosteroids were used in 75 of 210 cases; a significant number of posterior subcapsular cataracts was found. Typical keratoconjunctivitis sicca developed in three of the uveitis cases. This association with uveitis and JRA was not noted previously. Surgical treatment of cataracts, band keratopathy, and glaucoma achieved uniformly discouraging results.";neurological

Ocular motility changes after subtenon carboplatin chemotherapy for retinoblastoma.;BACKGROUND: Focal subtenon carboplatin injections have recently been used as a presumably toxicity-free adjunct to systemic chemotherapy for intraocular retinoblastoma. OBJECTIVE: To report our clinical experience with abnormal ocular motility in patients treated with subtenon carboplatin chemotherapy. METHODS: We noted abnormal ocular motility in 10 consecutive patients with retinoblastoma who had received subtenon carboplatin. During ocular manipulation under general anesthesia, we assessed their eyes by forced duction testing, comparing ocular motility after tumor control with ocular motility at diagnosis. Eyes subsequently enucleated because of treatment failure (n = 4) were examined histologically. RESULTS: Limitation of ocular motility was detected in all 12 eyes of 10 patients treated for intraocular retinoblastoma with 1 to 6 injections of subtenon carboplatin as part of multimodality therapy. Histopathological examination revealed many lipophages in the periorbital fat surrounding the optic nerve in 1 eye, indicative of phagocytosis of previously existing fat cells and suggesting prior fat necrosis. The enucleations were technically difficult and hazardous for globe rupture because of extensive orbital soft tissue adhesions. CONCLUSIONS: Subtenon carboplatin chemotherapy is associated with significant fibrosis of orbital soft tissues, leading to mechanical restriction of eye movements and making subsequent enucleation difficult. Subtenon carboplatin is not free of toxicity, and its use is best restricted to specific indications.;oncological
Carbamazepine-induced cardiac dysfunction. Characterization of two distinct clinical syndromes.;A patient with sinus bradycardia and atrioventricular block, induced by carbamazepine, prompted an extensive literature review of all previously reported cases. From the analysis of these cases, two distinct forms of carbamazepine-associated cardiac dysfunction emerged. One patient group developed sinus tachycardias in the setting of a massive carbamazepine overdose. The second group consisted almost exclusively of elderly women who developed potentially life-threatening bradyarrhythmias or atrioventricular conduction delay, associated with either therapeutic or modestly elevated carbamazepine serum levels. Because carbamazepine is widely used in the treatment of many neurologic and psychiatric conditions, the recognition of the latter syndrome has important implications for the use of this drug in elderly patients.;neurological|cardiovascular
Case-control study of regular analgesic and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory use and end-stage renal disease.;BACKGROUND: Studies on the association between the long-term use of aspirin and other analgesic and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) have given conflicting results. In order to examine this association, a case-control study with incident cases of ESRD was carried out. METHODS: The cases were all patients entering the local dialysis program because of ESRD in the study area between June 1, 1995 and November 30, 1997. They were classified according to the underlying disease, which had presumably led them to ESRD. Controls were patients admitted to the same hospitals from where the cases arose, also matched by age and sex. Odds ratios were calculated using a conditional logistic model, including potential confounding factors, both for the whole study population and for the various underlying diseases. RESULTS: Five hundred and eighty-three cases and 1190 controls were included in the analysis. Long-term use of any analgesic was associated with an overall odds ratio of 1.22 (95% CI, 0.89-1.66). For specific groups of drugs, the risks were 1.56 (1.05-2.30) for aspirin, 1.03 (0.60-1.76) for pyrazolones, 0.80 (0.39-1.63) for paracetamol, and 0.94 (0.57-1.56) for nonaspirin NSAIDs. The risk of ESRD associated with aspirin was related to the cumulated dose and duration of use, and it was particularly high among the subset of patients with vascular nephropathy as underlying disease [2.35 (1.17-4.72)]. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that long-term use of nonaspirin analgesic drugs and NSAIDs is not associated with an increased risk of ESRD. However, the chronic use of aspirin may increase the risk of ESRD.;hepatorenal

Trimethoprim-induced immune hemolytic anemia in a pediatric oncology patient presenting as an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction.;A 10-year-old male with acute leukemia presented with post-chemotherapy anemia. During red cell transfusion, he developed hemoglobinuria. Transfusion reaction workup was negative. Drug-induced immune hemolytic anemia was suspected because of positive direct antiglobulin test, negative eluate, and microspherocytes on smear pre- and post-transfusion. Drug studies using the indirect antiglobulin test were strongly positive with trimethoprim and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole but negative with sulfamethoxazole. The patient recovered after discontinuing the drug, with no recurrence in 2 years. Other causes of anemia should be considered in patients with worse-than-expected anemia after chemotherapy. Furthermore, hemolysis during transfusion is not always a transfusion reaction.;oncological
Cocaine causes memory and learning impairments in rats: involvement of nuclear factor kappa B and oxidative stress, and prevention by topiramate.;Different mechanisms have been suggested for cocaine toxicity including an increase in oxidative stress but the association between oxidative status in the brain and cocaine induced-behaviour is poorly understood. Nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB) is a sensor of oxidative stress and participates in memory formation that could be involved in drug toxicity and addiction mechanisms. Therefore NFkappaB activity, oxidative stress, neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) activity, spatial learning and memory as well as the effect of topiramate, a previously proposed therapy for cocaine addiction, were evaluated in an experimental model of cocaine administration in rats. NFkappaB activity was decreased in the frontal cortex of cocaine treated rats, as well as GSH concentration and glutathione peroxidase activity in the hippocampus, whereas nNOS activity in the hippocampus was increased. Memory retrieval of experiences acquired prior to cocaine administration was impaired and negatively correlated with NFkappaB activity in the frontal cortex. In contrast, learning of new tasks was enhanced and correlated with the increase of nNOS activity and the decrease of glutathione peroxidase. These results provide evidence for a possible mechanistic role of oxidative and nitrosative stress and NFkappaB in the alterations induced by cocaine. Topiramate prevented all the alterations observed, showing novel neuroprotective properties.;neurological

Frequency of transient ipsilateral vocal cord paralysis in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy under local anesthesia.;BACKGROUND: Especially because of improvements in clinical neurologic monitoring, carotid endarterectomy done under local anesthesia has become the technique of choice in several centers. Temporary ipsilateral vocal nerve palsies due to local anesthetics have been described, however. Such complications are most important in situations where there is a pre-existing contralateral paralysis. We therefore examined the effect of local anesthesia on vocal cord function to better understand its possible consequences. METHODS: This prospective study included 28 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy under local anesthesia. Vocal cord function was evaluated before, during, and after surgery (postoperative day 1) using flexible laryngoscopy. Anesthesia was performed by injecting 20 to 40 mL of a mixture of long-acting (ropivacaine) and short-acting (prilocaine) anesthetic. RESULTS: All patients had normal vocal cord function preoperatively. Twelve patients (43%) were found to have intraoperative ipsilateral vocal cord paralysis. It resolved in all cases < or =24 hours. There were no significant differences in operating time or volume or frequency of anesthetic administration in patients with temporary vocal cord paralysis compared with those without. CONCLUSION: Local anesthesia led to temporary ipsilateral vocal cord paralysis in almost half of these patients. Because pre-existing paralysis is of a relevant frequency (up to 3%), a preoperative evaluation of vocal cord function before carotid endarterectomy under local anesthesia is recommended to avoid intraoperative bilateral paralysis. In patients with preoperative contralateral vocal cord paralysis, surgery under general anesthesia should be considered.;neurological

An integrated characterization of serological, pathological, and functional events in doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity.;"Many efficacious cancer treatments cause significant cardiac morbidity, yet biomarkers or functional indices of early damage, which would allow monitoring and intervention, are lacking. In this study, we have utilized a rat model of progressive doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiomyopathy, applying multiple approaches, including cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to provide the most comprehensive characterization to date of the timecourse of serological, pathological, and functional events underlying this toxicity. Hannover Wistar rats were dosed with 1.25 mg/kg DOX weekly for 8 weeks followed by a 4 week off-dosing ""recovery"" period. Electron microscopy of the myocardium revealed subcellular degeneration and marked mitochondrial changes after a single dose. Histopathological analysis revealed progressive cardiomyocyte degeneration, hypertrophy/cytomegaly, and extensive vacuolation after two doses. Extensive replacement fibrosis (quantified by Sirius red staining) developed during the off-dosing period. Functional indices assessed by cardiac MRI (including left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), cardiac output, and E/A ratio) declined progressively, reaching statistical significance after two doses and culminating in ""clinical"" LV dysfunction by 12 weeks. Significant increases in peak myocardial contrast enhancement and serological cardiac troponin I (cTnI) emerged after eight doses, importantly preceding the LVEF decline to <50%. Troponin I levels positively correlated with delayed and peak gadolinium contrast enhancement, histopathological grading, and diastolic dysfunction. In summary, subcellular cardiomyocyte degeneration was the earliest marker, followed by progressive functional decline and histopathological manifestations. Myocardial contrast enhancement and elevations in cTnI occurred later. However, all indices predated ""clinical"" LV dysfunction and thus warrant further evaluation as predictive biomarkers.";cardiovascular|oncological
End-stage renal disease (ESRD) after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLTX) using calcineurin-based immunotherapy: risk of development and treatment.;"BACKGROUND: The calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporine and tacrolimus are both known to be nephrotoxic. Their use in orthotopic liver transplantation (OLTX) has dramatically improved success rates. Recently, however, we have had an increase of patients who are presenting after OLTX with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). This retrospective study examines the incidence and treatment of ESRD and chronic renal failure (CRF) in OLTX patients. METHODS: Patients receiving an OLTX only from June 1985 through December of 1994 who survived 6 months postoperatively were studied (n=834). Our prospectively collected database was the source of information. Patients were divided into three groups: Controls, no CRF or ESRD, n=748; CRF, sustained serum creatinine >2.5 mg/dl, n=41; and ESRD, n=45. Groups were compared for preoperative laboratory variables, diagnosis, postoperative variables, survival, type of ESRD therapy, and survival from onset of ESRD. RESULTS: At 13 years after OLTX, the incidence of severe renal dysfunction was 18.1% (CRF 8.6% and ESRD 9.5%). Compared with control patients, CRF and ESRD patients had higher preoperative serum creatinine levels, a greater percentage of patients with hepatorenal syndrome, higher percentage requirement for dialysis in the first 3 months postoperatively, and a higher 1-year serum creatinine. Multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis using preoperative and postoperative variables identified that an increase of serum creatinine compared with average at 1 year, 3 months, and 4 weeks postoperatively were independent risk factors for the development of CRF or ESRD with odds ratios of 2.6, 2.2, and 1.6, respectively. Overall survival from the time of OLTX was not significantly different among groups, but by year 13, the survival of the patients who had ESRD was only 28.2% compared with 54.6% in the control group. Patients developing ESRD had a 6-year survival after onset of ESRD of 27% for the patients receiving hemodialysis versus 71.4% for the patients developing ESRD who subsequently received kidney transplants. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who are more than 10 years post-OLTX have CRF and ESRD at a high rate. The development of ESRD decreases survival, particularly in those patients treated with dialysis only. Patients who develop ESRD have a higher preoperative and 1-year serum creatinine and are more likely to have hepatorenal syndrome. However, an increase of serum creatinine at various times postoperatively is more predictive of the development of CRF or ESRD. New strategies for long-term immunosuppression may be needed to decrease this complication.";hepatorenal

Adverse effects of the atypical antipsychotics. Collaborative Working Group on Clinical Trial Evaluations.;Adverse effects of antipsychotics often lead to noncompliance. Thus, clinicians should address patients' concerns about adverse effects and attempt to choose medications that will improve their patients' quality of life as well as overall health. The side effect profiles of the atypical antipsychotics are more advantageous than those of the conventional neuroleptics. Conventional agents are associated with unwanted central nervous system effects, including extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), tardive dyskinesia, sedation, and possible impairment of some cognitive measures, as well as cardiac effects, orthostatic hypotension, hepatic changes, anticholinergic side effects, sexual dysfunction, and weight gain. The newer atypical agents have a lower risk of EPS, but are associated in varying degrees with sedation, cardiovascular effects, anticholinergic effects, weight gain, sexual dysfunction, hepatic effects, lowered seizure threshold (primarily clozapine), and agranulocytosis (clozapine only). Since the incidence and severity of specific adverse effects differ among the various atypicals, the clinician should carefully consider which side effects are most likely to lead to the individual's dissatisfaction and noncompliance before choosing an antipsychotic for a particular patient.;neurological|cardiovascular|hepatorenal

Paclitaxel, cisplatin, and gemcitabine combination chemotherapy within a multidisciplinary therapeutic approach in metastatic nonsmall cell lung carcinoma.;"BACKGROUND: Cisplatin-based chemotherapy combinations improve quality of life and survival in advanced nonsmall cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). The emergence of new active drugs might translate into more effective regimens for the treatment of this disease. METHODS: The objective of this study was to determine the feasibility, response rate, and toxicity of a paclitaxel, cisplatin, and gemcitabine combination to treat metastatic NSCLC. Thirty-five consecutive chemotherapy-naive patients with Stage IV NSCLC and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2 were treated with a combination of paclitaxel (135 mg/m(2) given intravenously in 3 hours) on Day 1, cisplatin (120 mg/m(2) given intravenously in 6 hours) on Day 1, and gemcitabine (800 mg/m(2) given intravenously in 30 minutes) on Days 1 and 8, every 4 weeks. Although responding patients were scheduled to receive consolidation radiotherapy and 24 patients received preplanned second-line chemotherapy after disease progression, the response and toxicity rates reported refer only to the chemotherapy regimen given. RESULTS: All the patients were examined for toxicity; 34 were examinable for response. An objective response was observed in 73.5% of the patients (95% confidence interval [CI], 55.6-87.1%), including 4 complete responses (11.7%). According to intention-to-treat, the overall response rate was 71.4% (95% CI, 53. 7-85.4%). After 154 courses of therapy, the median dose intensity was 131 mg/m(2) for paclitaxel (97.3%), 117 mg/m(2) for cisplatin (97.3%), and 1378 mg/m(2) for gemcitabine (86.2%). World Health Organization Grade 3-4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia occurred in 39.9% and 11.4% of patients, respectively. There was one treatment-related death. Nonhematologic toxicities were mild. After a median follow-up of 22 months, the median progression free survival rate was 7 months, and the median survival time was 16 months. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of paclitaxel, cisplatin, and gemcitabine is well tolerated and shows high activity in metastatic NSCLC. This treatment merits further comparison with other cisplatin-based regimens.";oncological
Deletions of a DNA sequence in retinoblastomas and mesenchymal tumors: organization of the sequence and its encoded protein.;Retinoblastoma is a childhood tumor that can arise because of mutant alleles acquired as somatic or germinal mutations . The mutant allele can be carried in the germ line . The mutations creating these alleles act by inactivating copies of a recessive oncogene located within band q14 of chromosome 13 and termed the RB1 locus . We have reported isolation of a cDNA fragment that recognizes chromosomal sequences possessing many of the attributes of the retinoblastoma gene associated with the RB1 locus . We now report that this segment is additionally the target of somatic mutations in mesenchymal tumors among patients having no apparent predisposition to retinoblastoma and no previous evidence of retinoblastoma . These tumors provide additional evidence that the cloned sequences are representative of a gene that is a frequent target of inactivation during tumorigenesis . Sequence analysis of this cDNA provides little insight into its normal functional role . .;oncological

Effect of some convulsants on the protective activity of loreclezole and its combinations with valproate or clonazepam in amygdala-kindled rats.;Loreclezole (5 mg/kg) exerted a significant protective action in amygdala-kindled rats, reducing both seizure and afterdischarge durations. The combinations of loreclezole (2.5 mg/kg) with valproate, clonazepam, or carbamazepine (applied at their subprotective doses) also exhibited antiseizure effect in this test. However, only two first combinations occurred to be of pharmacodynamic nature. Among several chemoconvulsants, bicuculline, N-methyl-D-aspartic acid and BAY k-8644 (the opener of L-type calcium channels) reversed the protective activity of loreclezole alone and its combination with valproate. On the other hand, bicuculline, aminophylline and BAY k-8644 inhibited the anticonvulsive action of loreclezole combined with clonazepam. The results support the hypothesis that the protective activity of loreclezole and its combinations with other antiepileptics may involve potentiation of GABAergic neurotransmission and blockade of L-type of calcium channels.;neurological

Heart failure: to digitalise or not? The view against.;Despite extensive clinical experience the role of digoxin is still not well defined. In patients with atrial fibrillation digoxin is beneficial for ventricular rate control. For patients in sinus rhythm and heart failure the situation is less clear. Digoxin has a narrow therapeutic:toxic ratio and concentrations are affected by a number of drugs. Also, digoxin has undesirable effects such as increasing peripheral resistance and myocardial demands, and causing arrhythmias. There is a paucity of data from well-designed trials. The trials that are available are generally small with limitations in design and these show variation in patient benefit. More convincing evidence is required showing that digoxin improves symptoms or exercise capacity. Furthermore, no trial has had sufficient power to evaluate mortality. Pooled analysis of the effects of other inotropic drugs shows an excess mortality and there is a possibility that digoxin may increase mortality after myocardial infarction (MI). Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors should be used first as they are safer, do not require blood level monitoring, modify progression of disease, relieve symptoms, improve exercise tolerance and reduce mortality. Caution should be exercised in using digoxin until large mortality trials are completed showing either benefit or harm. Until then digoxin should be considered a third-line therapy.;neurological|cardiovascular

Myotonic dystrophy protein kinase is involved in the modulation of the Ca2+ homeostasis in skeletal muscle cells.;"Myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) , the most prevalent muscular disorder in adults , is caused by ( CTG ) n-repeat expansion in a gene encoding a protein kinase ( DM protein kinase ; DMPK ) and involves changes in cytoarchitecture and ion homeostasis . To obtain clues to the normal biological role of DMPK in cellular ion homeostasis , we have compared the resting [ Ca2 + ] i , the amplitude and shape of depolarization-induced Ca2 + transients , and the content of ATP-driven ion pumps in cultured skeletal muscle cells of wild-type and DMPK [ - / - ] knockout mice . In vitro-differentiated DMPK [ - / - ] myotubes exhibit a higher resting [ Ca2 + ] i than do wild-type myotubes because of an altered open probability of voltage-dependent l-type Ca2 + and Na + channels . The mutant myotubes exhibit smaller and slower Ca2 + responses upon triggering by acetylcholine or high external K + . In addition , we observed that these Ca2 + transients partially result from an influx of extracellular Ca2 + through the l-type Ca2 + channel . Neither the content nor the activity of Na + / K + ATPase and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2 + -ATPase are affected by DMPK absence . In conclusion , our data suggest that DMPK is involved in modulating the initial events of excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle . .";neurological
The risk of venous thromboembolism in women prescribed cyproterone acetate in combination with ethinyl estradiol: a nested cohort analysis and case-control study.;BACKGROUND: Cyproterone acetate combined with ethinyl estradiol (CPA/EE) is licensed in the UK for the treatment of women with acne and hirsutism and is also a treatment option for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Previous studies have demonstrated an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) associated with CPA/EE compared with conventional combined oral contraceptives (COCs). We believe the results of those studies may have been affected by residual confounding. METHODS: Using the General Practice Research Database we conducted a cohort analysis and case-control study nested within a population of women aged between 15 and 39 years with acne, hirsutism or PCOS to estimate the risk of VTE associated with CPA/EE. RESULTS: The age-adjusted incidence rate ratio for CPA/EE versus conventional COCs was 2.20 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.35-3.58]. Using as the reference group women who were not using oral contraception, had no recent pregnancy or menopausal symptoms, the case-control analysis gave an adjusted odds ratio (OR(adj)) of 7.44 (95% CI 3.67-15.08) for CPA/EE use compared with an OR(adj) of 2.58 (95% CI 1.60-4.18) for use of conventional COCs. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated an increased risk of VTE associated with the use of CPA/EE in women with acne, hirsutism or PCOS although residual confounding by indication cannot be excluded.;neurological
Mechanisms of FK 506-induced hypertension in the rat.;-Tacrolimus (FK 506) is a powerful, widely used immunosuppressant. The clinical utility of FK 506 is complicated by substantial hypertension and nephrotoxicity. To clarify the mechanisms of FK 506-induced hypertension, we studied the chronic effects of FK 506 on the synthesis of endothelin-1 (ET-1), the expression of mRNA of ET-1 and endothelin-converting enzyme-1 (ECE-1), the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity, and the expression of mRNA of eNOS and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) in rat blood vessels. In addition, the effect of the specific endothelin type A receptor antagonist FR 139317 on FK 506-induced hypertension in rats was studied. FK 506, 5 mg. kg-1. d-1 given for 4 weeks, elevated blood pressure from 102+/-13 to 152+/-15 mm Hg and increased the synthesis of ET-1 and the levels of ET-1 mRNA in the mesenteric artery (240% and 230%, respectively). Little change was observed in the expression of ECE-1 mRNA and CNP mRNA. FK 506 decreased eNOS activity and the levels of eNOS mRNA in the aorta (48% and 55%, respectively). The administration of FR 139317 (10 mg. kg-1. d-1) prevented FK 506-induced hypertension in rats. These results indicate that FK 506 may increase blood pressure not only by increasing ET-1 production but also by decreasing NO synthesis in the vasculature.;neurological|cardiovascular|hepatorenal

A pilot study to assess the safety of dobutamine stress echocardiography in the emergency department evaluation of cocaine-associated chest pain.;STUDY OBJECTIVE: Chest pain in the setting of cocaine use poses a diagnostic dilemma. Dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) is a widely available and sensitive test for evaluating cardiac ischemia. Because of the theoretical concern regarding administration of dobutamine in the setting of cocaine use, we conducted a pilot study to assess the safety of DSE in emergency department patients with cocaine-associated chest pain. METHODS: A prospective case series was conducted in the intensive diagnostic and treatment unit in the ED of an urban tertiary-care teaching hospital. Patients were eligible for DSE if they had used cocaine within 24 hours preceding the onset of chest pain and had a normal ECG and tropinin I level. Patients exhibiting signs of continuing cocaine toxicity were excluded from the study. All patients were admitted to the hospital for serial testing after the DSE testing in the intensive diagnostic and treatment unit. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were enrolled. Two patients had inadequate resting images, one DSE was terminated because of inferior hypokinesis, another DSE was terminated because of a rate-related atrial conduction deficit, and 1 patient did not reach the target heart rate. Thus, 19 patients completed a DSE and reached their target heart rates. None of the patients experienced signs of exaggerated adrenergic response, which was defined as a systolic blood pressure of greater than 200 mm Hg or the occurrence of tachydysrhythmias (excluding sinus tachycardia). Further suggesting lack of exaggerated adrenergic response, 13 (65%) of 20 patients required supplemental atropine to reach their target heart rates. CONCLUSION: No exaggerated adrenergic response was detected when dobutamine was administered to patients with cocaine-related chest pain.;cardiovascular

Low-molecular-weight heparin for the treatment of patients with mechanical heart valves.;"BACKGROUND: The interruption of oral anticoagulant (OAC) administration is sometimes indicated in patients with mechanical heart valves, mainly before noncardiac surgery, non-surgical interventions, and pregnancy. Unfractionated heparin (UH) is currently the substitute for selected patients. Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) offers theoretical advantages over UH, but is not currently considered in clinical guidelines as an alternative to UH in patients with prosthetic valves. HYPOTHESIS: The aim of the present study was to review the data accumulated so far on the use of LMWH in this patient population and to discuss its applicability in common practice. METHODS: For this paper, the current medical literature on LMWH in patients with mechanical heart valves was extensively reviewed. RESULTS: There were eight series and six case reports. None of the studies was randomized, and only one was prospective. Data to establish the thromboembolic risk were incomplete. After excluding case reports, the following groups were constructed: (a) short-term administration, after valve insertion (n = 212); (b) short-term, perioperative (noncardiac)/periprocedural (n = 114); (c) long-term, due to intolerance to OAC (n = 16); (d) long-term, in pregnancy (n = 10). The incidence rate of thromboembolism was 0.9% for all the studies and 0.5, 0, 20, and 0% in groups a, b, c, and d, respectively; for hemorrhage, the overall rate was 3.4% (3.8, 2.6, 10, and 0% for the respective groups). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with mechanical heart valves, short-term LMWH therapy compares favorably with UH. Data on mid- and long-term LMWH administration in these patients are sparse. Further randomized studies are needed to confirm the safety and precise indications for the use of LMWH in patients with mechanical heart valves.";cardiovascular

Association of BRCA1 with the hRad50-hMre11-p95 complex and the DNA damage response.;BRCA1 encodes a tumor suppressor that is mutated in familial breast and ovarian cancers . Here , it is shown that BRCA1 interacts in vitro and in vivo with hRad50 , which forms a complex with hMre11 and p95 / nibrin . Upon irradiation , BRCA1 was detected in discrete foci in the nucleus , which colocalize with hRad50 . Formation of irradiation-induced foci positive for BRCA1 , hRad50 , hMre11 , or p95 was dramatically reduced in HCC / 1937 breast cancer cells carrying a homozygous mutation in BRCA1 but was restored by transfection of wild-type BRCA1 . Ectopic expression of wild-type , but not mutated , BRCA1 in these cells rendered them less sensitive to the DNA damage agent , methyl methanesulfonate . These data suggest that BRCA1 is important for the cellular responses to DNA damage that are mediated by the hRad50-hMre11-p95 complex . .;neurological|oncological

Aminoglycoside antibiotics restore dystrophin function to skeletal muscles of mdx mice.;Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD ) is caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene , leading to the absence of the dystrophin protein in striated muscle . A significant number of these mutations are premature stop codons . On the basis of the observation that aminoglycoside treatment can suppress stop codons in cultured cells , we tested the effect of gentamicin on cultured muscle cells from the mdx mouse - an animal model for DMD that possesses a premature stop codon in the dystrophin gene . Exposure of mdx myotubes to gentamicin led to the expression and localization of dystrophin to the cell membrane . We then evaluated the effects of differing dosages of gentamicin on expression and functional protection of the muscles of mdx mice . We identified a treatment regimen that resulted in the presence of dystrophin in the cell membrane in all striated muscles examined and that provided functional protection against muscular injury . To our knowledge , our results are the first to demonstrate that aminoglycosides can suppress stop codons not only in vitro but also in vivo . Furthermore , these results raise the possibility of a novel treatment regimen for muscular dystrophy and other diseases caused by premature stop codon mutations . This treatment could prove effective in up to 15 % of patients with DMD . .;neurological

A common human skin tumour is caused by activating mutations in beta-catenin.;WNT signalling orchestrates a number of developmental programs . In response to this stimulus , cytoplasmic beta-catenin ( encoded by CTNNB1 ) is stabilized , enabling downstream transcriptional activation by members of the LEF / TCF family . One of the target genes for beta-catenin / TCF encodes c-MYC , explaining why constitutive activation of the WNT pathway can lead to cancer , particularly in the colon . Most colon cancers arise from mutations in the gene encoding adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC ) , a protein required for ubiquitin-mediated degradation of beta-catenin , but a small percentage of colon and some other cancers harbour beta-catenin-stabilizing mutations . Recently , we discovered that transgenic mice expressing an activated beta-catenin are predisposed to developing skin tumours resembling pilomatricomas . Given that the skin of these adult mice also exhibits signs of de novo hair-follicle morphogenesis , we wondered whether human pilomatricomas might originate from hair matrix cells and whether they might possess beta-catenin-stabilizing mutations . Here , we explore the cell origin and aetiology of this common human skin tumour . We found nuclear LEF-1 in the dividing tumour cells , providing biochemical evidence that pilomatricomas are derived from hair matrix cells . At least 75 % of these tumours possess mutations affecting the amino-terminal segment , normally involved in phosphorylation-dependent , ubiquitin-mediated degradation of the protein . This percentage of CTNNB1 mutations is greater than in all other human tumours examined thus far , and directly implicates beta-catenin / LEF misregulation as the major cause of hair matrix cell tumorigenesis in humans . .;neurological|oncological
Hyperkalemia induced by indomethacin and naproxen and reversed by fludrocortisone.;We have described a patient with severe rheumatoid arthritis and a history of mefenamic acid nephropathy in whom hyperkalemia and inappropriate hypoaldosteronism were caused by both indomethacin and naproxen, without major decline in renal function. It is likely that preexisting renal disease predisposed this patient to type IV renal tubular acidosis with prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors. Because he was unable to discontinue nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy, fludrocortisone was added, correcting the hyperkalemia and allowing indomethacin therapy to be continued safely.;hepatorenal

Dual roles of ATM in the cellular response to radiation and in cell growth control.;The gene mutated in ataxia-telangiectasia ( AT ) patients , denoted ATM , encodes a putative protein or lipid kinase . To elucidate the functions of ATM , we disrupted the mouse ATM gene through homologous recombination in mice . Consistent with cellular defects of AT patients , the ATM- / - cells are hypersensitive to gamma-irradiation and defective in cell-cycle arrest following radiation , correlating with a defective up-regulation of p53 . In addition , ATM- / - mouse thymocytes are more resistant to apoptosis induced by gamma-irradiation than normal thymocytes . ATM- / - fibroblasts are inefficient in G1 to S-phase progression following serum stimulation and senesce after only a few passages in culture . They have an increased constitutive level of p21CP1 / WAF1 . The ATM protein is therefore critical both for cellular responses to ionizing radiation and for normal cell-cycle progression . ATM + / - fibroblasts and thymocytes showed intermediately defective responses to irradiation but no growth defect , suggesting that the increased cancer risk of AT heterozygotes could be attributable to poor checkpoint function . .;neurological|oncological
Acute hepatitis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and erythroblastocytopenia induced by ceftriaxone.;An 80-yr-old man developed acute hepatitis shortly after ingesting oral ceftriaxone. Although the transaminases gradually returned to baseline after withholding the beta lactam antibiotic, there was a gradual increase in serum bilirubin and a decrease in hemoglobin concentration caused by an autoimmune hemolytic anemia and erythroblastocytopenia. These responded to systemic steroids and immunoglobulins. Despite the widespread use of these agents this triad of side effects has not previously been reported in connection with beta lactam antibiotics.;hepatorenal

Rapid reversal of anticoagulation reduces hemorrhage volume in a mouse model of warfarin-associated intracerebral hemorrhage.;Warfarin-associated intracerebral hemorrhage (W-ICH) is a severe type of stroke. There is no consensus on the optimal treatment for W-ICH. Using a mouse model, we tested whether the rapid reversal of anticoagulation using human prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) can reduce hemorrhagic blood volume. Male CD-1 mice were treated with warfarin (2 mg/kg over 24 h), resulting in a mean (+/-s.d.) International Normalized Ratio of 3.5+/-0.9. First, we showed that an intravenous administration of human PCC rapidly reversed anticoagulation in mice. Second, a stereotactic injection of collagenase was administered to induce hemorrhage in the right striatum. Forty-five minutes later, the animals were randomly treated with PCC (100 U/kg) or saline i.v. (n=12 per group). Twenty-four hours after hemorrhage induction, hemorrhagic blood volume was quantified using a photometric hemoglobin assay. The mean hemorrhagic blood volume was reduced in PCC-treated animals (6.5+/-3.1 microL) compared with saline controls (15.3+/-11.2 microL, P=0.015). In the saline group, 45% of the mice developed large hematomas (i.e., >15 microL). In contrast, such extensive lesions were never found in the PCC group. We provide experimental data suggesting PCC to be an effective acute treatment for W-ICH in terms of reducing hemorrhagic blood volume. Future studies are needed to assess the therapeutic potential emerging from our finding for human W-ICH.;neurological
Methyldopa-induced hemolytic anemia in a 15 year old presenting as near-syncope.;Methyldopa is an antihypertensive medication which is available generically and under the trade name Aldomet that is widely prescribed in the adult population and infrequently used in children. Methyldopa causes an autoimmune hemolytic anemia in a small percentage of patients who take the drug. We report a case of methyldopa-induced hemolytic anemia in a 15-year-old boy who presented to the emergency department with near-syncope. The boy had been treated with intravenous methyldopa during a trauma admission seven weeks prior to presentation. Evaluation revealed a hemoglobin of three grams, 3+ Coombs' test with polyspecific anti-human globulin and monospecific IgG reagents, and a warm reacting autoantibody. Transfusion and corticosteroid therapy resulted in a complete recovery of the patient. Emergency physicians treating children must be aware of this syndrome in order to diagnose and treat it correctly.

Interactive effects of variations in [Na]o and [Ca]o on rat atrial spontaneous frequency.;"The effects of varying the extracellular concentrations of Na and Ca ([Na]o and [Ca]o) on both, the spontaneous beating and the negative chronotropic action of verapamil, were studied in the isolated rat atria. Basal frequency (BF) evaluated by surface electrogram was 223 +/- 4 beats/min. in control Krebs-Ringer containing 137 mM Na and 1.35 mM Ca (N). It decreased by 16 +/- 3% by lowering [Na]o to 78 mM (LNa), 23 +/- 2% by lowering simultaneously [Na]o to 78 mM and [Ca]o to 0.675 mM (LNa+LCa) and 31 +/- 5% by lowering [Na]o to 78 mM plus increasing [Ca]o to 3.6 mM (LNa+HCa). At normal [Na]o, decrease (0.675 mM) or increase (3.6 mM) of [Ca]o did not modify BF; a reduction of ten times (0.135 mM of normal [Ca]o was effective to reduce BF by 40 +/- 13%. All negative chronotropic effects were BF-dependent. Dose-dependent bradycardia induced by verapamil was potentiated by LNa, LCa, and HCa. Independent but not additive effects of Na and Ca are shown by decreases in the values of [verapamil]o needed to reduce BF by 30% (IC30) with the following order of inhibitory potency: LNa > LCa > HCa > N, resulting LNa+HCa similar to LNa. The [verapamil]o that arrested atrial beating (AC) was also potentiated with the order LNa = LNa+LCa = LNa+HCa = LCa > HCa = N. The results indicate that rat atrial spontaneous beating is more dependent on [Na]o than on [Ca]o in a range of +/- 50% of their normal concentration. Also the enhancement of verapamil effects on atrial beating was more pronounced at LNa than at LCa.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)";cardiovascular
Mutation spectrum and genotype-phenotype analyses in Cowden disease and Bannayan-Zonana syndrome, two hamartoma syndromes with germline PTEN mutation.;"The tumour suppressor gene PTEN , which maps to 10q23 . 3 and encodes a 403 amino acid dual specificity phosphatase ( protein tyrosine phosphatase ; PTPase ) , was shown recently to play a broad role in human malignancy . Somatic PTEN deletions and mutations were observed in sporadic breast , brain , prostate and kidney cancer cell lines and in several primary tumours such as endometrial carcinomas , malignant melanoma and thyroid tumours . In addition , PTEN was identified as the susceptibility gene for two hamartoma syndromes  Cowden disease ( CD ; MIM 158350 ) and Bannayan-Zonana ( BZS ) or Ruvalcaba-Riley-Smith syndrome ( MIM 153480 ) . Constitutive DNA from 37 CD families and seven BZS families was screened for germline PTEN mutations . PTEN mutations were identified in 30 of 37 ( 81 % ) CD families , including missense and nonsense point mutations , deletions , insertions , a deletion / insertion and splice site mutations . These mutations were scattered over the entire length of PTEN , with the exception of the first , fourth and last exons . A hot spot for PTEN mutation in CD was identified in exon 5 that contains the PTPase core motif , with 13 of 30 ( 43 % ) CD mutations identified in this exon . Seven of 30 ( 23 % ) were within the core motif , the majority ( five of seven ) of which were missense mutations , possibly pointing to the functional significance of this region . Germline PTEN mutations were identified in four of seven ( 57 % ) BZS families studied . Interestingly , none of these mutations was observed in the PTPase core motif . It is also worthy of note that a single nonsense point mutation , R233X , was observed in the germline DNA from two unrelated CD families and one BZS family . Genotype-phenotype studies were not performed on this small group of BZS families . However , genotype-phenotype analysis inthe group of CD families revealed two possible associations worthy of follow-up in independent analyses . The first was an association noted in the group of CD families with breast disease . A correlation was observed between the presence / absence of a PTEN mutation and the type of breast involvement ( unaffected versus benign versus malignant ) . Specifically and more directly , an association was also observed between the presence of a PTEN mutation and malignant breast disease . Secondly , there appeared to be an interdependent association between mutations upstream and within the PTPase core motif , the core motif containing the majority of missense mutations , and the involvement of all major organ systems ( central nervous system , thyroid , breast , skin and gastrointestinal tract ) . However , these observations would need to be confirmed by studying a larger number of CD families .";neurological|hepatorenal|oncological

Intramuscular hepatitis B immune globulin combined with lamivudine in prevention of hepatitis B recurrence after liver transplantation.;BACKGROUND: Combined hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIg) and lamivudine in prophylaxis of the recurrence of hepatitis B after liver transplantation has significantly improved the survival of HBsAg positive patients. This study was undertaken to evaluate the outcomes of liver transplantation for patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV). METHODS: A retrospective chart analysis and a review of the organ transplant database identified 51 patients (43 men and 8 women) transplanted for benign HBV-related cirrhotic diseases between June 2002 and December 2004 who had survived more than 3 months. HBIg was administered intravenously during the first week and intramuscularly thereafter. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 14.1 months, the overall recurrence rate in the 51 patients was 3.9% (2/51). The overall patient survival was 88.3%, and 82.4% after 1 and 2 years, respectively. A daily oral dose of 100 mg lamivudine for 2 weeks before transplantation for 10 patients enabled 57.1% (4/7) and 62.5% (5/8) of HBV-DNA and HBeAg positive patients respectively to convert to be negative. Intramuscular HBIg was well tolerated in all patients. CONCLUSION: Lamivudine combined with intramuscular HBIg can effectively prevent allograft from the recurrence of HBV after liver transplantation.;hepatorenal

Immunohistochemical study on inducible type of nitric oxide (iNOS), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and tumor growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) in arteritis induced in rats by fenoldopam and theophylline, vasodilators.;"Arteritis induced in rats by vasodilators, fenoldopam and theophylline, was examined immunohistochemically for expressions of inducible type of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and tumor growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1). Rats were administered fenoldopam for 24 hours by intravenous infusion with or without following repeated daily oral administrations of theophylline. Irrespective of theophylline administration, iNOS antigens were remarkably abundant in ED-1-positive cells on day 5 and 8 post-fenoldopam-infusion (DPI); bFGF antigens were remarkably abundant in ED-1-positive cells on 1 and 3 DPI; TGF-beta1 antigens were observed in ED-1-positive cells on and after 5 DPI. These results suggest that the peak expression of iNOS antigen was followed by that of bFGF antigen, and bFGF may have a suppressive effect on iNOS expression in these rat arteritis models. On the other hand, TGF-beta1 was not considered to have a suppressive effect on iNOS expression in these models.";oncological

Debrisoquine phenotype and the pharmacokinetics and beta-2 receptor pharmacodynamics of metoprolol and its enantiomers.;The metabolism of the cardioselective beta-blocker metoprolol is under genetic control of the debrisoquine/sparteine type. The two metabolic phenotypes, extensive (EM) and poor metabolizers (PM), show different stereoselective metabolism, resulting in apparently higher beta-1 adrenoceptor antagonistic potency of racemic metoprolol in EMs. We investigated if the latter also applies to the beta-2 adrenoceptor antagonism by metoprolol. The drug effect studied was the antagonism by metoprolol of terbutaline-induced hypokalemia. By using pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic modeling the pharmacodynamics of racemic metoprolol and the active S-isomer, were quantitated in EMs and PMs in terms of IC50 values, representing metoprolol plasma concentrations resulting in half-maximum receptor occupancy. Six EMs received 0.5 mg of terbutaline s.c. on two different occasions: 1) 1 hr after administration of a placebo and 2) 1 hr after 150 mg of metoprolol p.o. Five PMs were studied according to the same protocol, except for a higher terbutaline dose (0.75 mg) on day 2. Blood samples for the analysis of plasma potassium, terbutaline, metoprolol (racemic, R- and S-isomer), and alpha-hydroxymetoprolol concentrations were taken at regular time intervals, during 8 hr after metoprolol. In PMs, metoprolol increased the terbutaline area under the plasma concentration vs. time curve (+67%). Higher metoprolol/alpha-hydroxymetoprolol ratios in PMs were predictive for higher R-/S-isomer ratios of unchanged drug. There was a difference in metoprolol potency with higher racemic metoprolol IC50 values in PMs (72 +/- 7 ng.ml-1) than EMs (42 +/- 8 ng.ml-1, P less than .001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS);neurological|cardiovascular

Doxorubicin cardiomyopathy-induced inflammation and apoptosis are attenuated by gene deletion of the kinin B1 receptor.;Clinical use of the anthracycline doxorubicin (DOX) is limited by its cardiotoxic effects, which are attributed to the induction of apoptosis. To elucidate the possible role of the kinin B1 receptor (B1R) during the development of DOX cardiomyopathy, we studied B1R knockout mice (B1R(-/-)) by investigating cardiac inflammation and apoptosis after induction of DOX-induced cardiomyopathy. DOX control mice showed cardiac dysfunction measured by pressure-volume loops in vivo. This was associated with a reduced activation state of AKT, as well as an increased bax/bcl2 ratio in Western blots, indicating cardiac apoptosis. Furthermore, mRNA levels of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 6 were increased in the cardiac tissue. In DOX B1R(-/-) mice, cardiac dysfunction was improved compared to DOX control mice, which was associated with normalization of the bax/bcl-2 ratio and interleukin 6, as well as AKT activation state. These findings suggest that B1R is detrimental in DOX cardiomyopathy in that it mediates the inflammatory response and apoptosis. These insights might have useful implications for future studies utilizing B1R antagonists for treatment of human DOX cardiomyopathy.;cardiovascular

Markedly accelerated catabolism of apolipoprotein A-II (ApoA-II) and high density lipoproteins containing ApoA-II in classic lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase deficiency and fish-eye disease.;"Classic ( complete ) lecithin  cholesterol acyltransferase ( LCAT ) deficiency and Fish-eye disease ( partial LCAT deficiency ) are genetic syndromes associated with markedly decreased plasma levels of high density lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterol but not with an increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease . We investigated the metabolism of the HDL apolipoproteins ( apo ) apoA-I and apoA-II in a total of five patients with LCAT deficiency , one with classic LCAT deficiency and four with Fish-eye disease . Plasma levels of apoA-II were decreased to a proportionately greater extent ( 23 % of normal ) than apoA-I ( 30 % of normal ) . In addition , plasma concentrations of HDL particles containing both apoA-I and apoA-II ( LpA-I  A-II ) were much lower ( 18 % of normal ) than those of particles containing only apoA-I ( LpA-I ) ( 51 % of normal ) . The metabolic basis for the low levels of apoA-II and LpA-I  A-II was investigated in all five patients using both exogenous radiotracer and endogenous stable isotope labeling techniques . The mean plasma residence time of apoA-I was decreased at 2 . 08 + / - 0 . 27 d ( controls 4 . 74 + / - 0 . 65 days ) ; however , the residence time of apoA-II was even shorter at 1 . 66 + / - 0 . 24 d ( controls 5 . 25 + / - 0 . 61 d ) . In addition , the catabolism of apoA-I in LpA-I  A-II was substantially faster than that of apoA-I in LpA-I . In summary , genetic syndromes of either complete or partial LCAT deficiency result in low levels of HDL through preferential hypercatabolism of apoA-II and HDL particles containing apoA-II . Because LpA-I has been proposed to be more protective than LpA-I  A-II against atherosclerosis , this selective effect on the metabolism of LpA-I  A-II may provide a potential explanation why patients with classic LCAT deficiency and Fish-eye disease are not at increased risk for premature atherosclerosis despite markedly decreased levels of HDL cholesterol and apoA-I";cardiovascular

Are Dp71 and Dp140 brain dystrophin isoforms related to cognitive impairment in Duchenne muscular dystrophy?;Molecular study and neuropsychological analysis were performed concurrently on 49 patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD ) in order to find a molecular explanation for the cognitive impairment observed in most DMD patients . Complete analysis of the dystrophin gene was performed to define the localization of deletions and duplications in relation to the different DMD promoters . Qualitative analysis of the Dp71 transcript and testing for the specific first exon of Dp140 were also carried out . Neuropsychological analysis assessed verbal and visuospatial intelligence , verbal memory , and reading skills . Comparison of molecular and psychometric findings demonstrated that deletions and duplications that were localized in the distal part of the gene seemed to be preferentially associated with cognitive impairment . Two altered Dp71 transcripts and two deleted Dp140 DNA sequences were found in four patients with severe cerebral dysfunction . These findings suggest that some sequences located in the distal part of the gene and , in particular , some DMD isoforms expressed in the brain may be related to the cognitive impairment associated with DMD . .;neurological
The spectrum of RB1 germ-line mutations in hereditary retinoblastoma.;We have searched for germ-line RB1 mutations in 119 patients with hereditary retinoblastoma . Previous investigations by Southern blot hybridization and PCR fragment-length analysis had revealed mutations in 48 patients . Here we report on the analysis of the remaining 71 patients . By applying heteroduplex analysis , nonisotopic SSCP , and direct sequencing , we detected germ-line mutations resulting in premature termination codons or disruption of splice signals in 51 ( 72 % ) of the 71 patients . Four patients also showed rare sequence variants . No region of the RB1 gene was preferentially involved in single base substitutions . Recurrent transitions were observed at most of the 14 codons within the RB1 . No mutation was observed in exons 25-27 , although this region contains two CGA codons . This suggests that mutations within the 3-terminal region of the RB1 gene may not be oncogenic . When these data were combined with the results of our previous investigations , mutations were identified in a total of 99 ( 83 % ) of 119 patients . The spectrum comprises 15 % large deletions , 26 % small length alterations , and 42 % base substitutions . No correlation between the location of frameshift or nonsense mutations and phenotypic features , including age at diagnosis , the number of tumor foci , and manifestation of nonocular tumors was observed . .;oncological
Complete atrioventricular block secondary to lithium therapy.;Sinus node dysfunction has been reported most frequently among the adverse cardiovascular effects of lithium. In the present case, complete atrioventricular (AV) block with syncopal attacks developed secondary to lithium therapy, necessitating permanent pacemaker implantation. Serum lithium levels remained under or within the therapeutic range during the syncopal attacks. Lithium should be used with extreme caution, especially in patients with mild disturbance of AV conduction.;cardiovascular

The normal Huntington disease (HD) allele, or a closely linked gene, influences age at onset of HD.;We evaluated the hypothesis that Huntington disease ( HD ) is influenced by the normal HD allele by comparing transmission patterns of genetically linked markers at the D4S10 locus in the normal parent against age at onset in the affected offspring . Analysis of information from 21 sibships in 14 kindreds showed a significant tendency for sibs who have similar onset ages to share the same D4S10 allele from the normal parent . Affected sibs who inherited different D4S10 alleles from the normal parent tended to have more variable ages at onset . These findings suggest that the expression of HD is modulated by the normal HD allele or by a closely linked locus . .;neurological
Severe and long lasting cholestasis after high-dose co-trimoxazole treatment for Pneumocystis pneumonia in HIV-infected patients--a report of two cases.;Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), a common opportunistic infection in HIV-infected individuals, is generally treated with high doses of co-trimoxazole. However, treatment is often limited by adverse effects. Here, we report two cases of severely immunocompromised HIV-infected patients who developed severe intrahepatic cholestasis, and in one patient lesions mimicking liver abscess formation on radiologic exams, during co-trimoxazole treatment for PCP. Whereas patient 1 showed lesions of up to 1 cm readily detectable on magnetic resonance imaging under prolonged co-trimoxazole treatment, therapy of patient 2 was switched early.;neurological|hepatorenal

Initial potassium loss and hypokalaemia during chlorthalidone administration in patients with essential hypertension: the influence of dietary sodium restriction.;"To investigate the initial potassium loss and development of hypokalaemia during the administration of an oral diuretic, metabolic balance studies were performed in ten patients with essential hypertension who had shown hypokalaemia under prior oral diuretic treatment. Chlorthalidone (50 mg daily) was given for 14 days. Six patients received a normal-sodium diet and four a low-sodium (17 mmol/day) diet. All patients had a normal initial total body potassium (40K). The electrolyte balances, weight, bromide space, plasma renin activity, and aldosterone secretion rate were measured. In both groups a potassium deficit developed, with proportionally larger losses from the extracellular than from the intracellular compartment. In the normal-sodium group the highest mean potassium deficit was 176 mmol on day 9, after which some potassium was regained; in the low-sodium group the highest deficit was 276 mmol on day 13. The normal-sodium group showed an immediate but temporary rise of the renin and aldosterone levels; in the low-sodium group renin and aldosterone increased more slowly but remained elevated. It is concluded that dietary sodium restriction increases diuretic-induced potassium loss, presumably by an increased activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, while sodium delivery to the distal renal tubules remains sufficiently high to allow increased potassium secretion.";cardiovascular|hepatorenal

Sorafenib-induced acute myocardial infarction due to coronary artery spasm.;A 65-year-old man with advanced renal cell carcinoma was admitted due to continuing chest pain at rest. Two weeks before his admission, sorafenib had been started. He was diagnosed with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction by laboratory data and electrocardiogram. Enhanced heart magnetic resonance imaging also showed subendocardial infarction. However, there was no stenosis in coronary arteries on angiography. Coronary artery spasm was induced by a provocative test. Cessation of sorafenib and administration of Ca-channel blocker and nitrates ameliorated his symptoms, but relapse occurred after resumption of sorafenib. Addition of oral nicorandil reduced his symptoms and maintained stable angina status. We report the first case of sorafenib-induced coronary artery spasm. Sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor that targets signaling pathways necessary for cellular proliferation and survival. On the other hand, the Rho/ROCK pathway has an important role in the pathogenesis of coronary artery spasm. Our report may show an adverse effect on the Rho/ROCK pathway by sorafenib use.;neurological|cardiovascular|hepatorenal|oncological

Piebaldism with deafness: molecular evidence for an expanded syndrome.;In a South African girl of Xhosa stock with severe piebaldism and profound congenital sensorineural deafness we identified a novel missense substitution at a highly conserved residue in the intracellular kinase domain of the KIT proto-oncogene , R796G . Though auditory anomalies have been observed in mice with dominant white spotting ( W ) due to KIT mutations , deafness is not typical in human piebaldism . Thus , the occurrence of sensorineural deafness in this patient extends considerably the phenotypic range of piebaldism due to KIT gene mutation in humans and tightens the clinical similarity between piebaldism and the various forms of Waardenburg syndrome . .;neurological|oncological
Intelligence quotient profile in myotonic dystrophy, intergenerational deficit, and correlation with CTG amplification.;"An abbreviated Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale Revised ( WAIS-R ) was used to assess verbal and arithmetical cognitive performance in 55 subjects with myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) , covering all grades of disease severity , and 31 controls at 50 % risk of inheriting DM . Scaled scores from the assessment were converted into an intelligence quotient ( IQ ) estimation on each person . Significant IQ differences were found between  ( 1 ) all 55 DM subjects ( mean 90 . 2 , SD 16 . 1 ) and 31 controls ( 102 . 6 , SD 9 . 4 ) , with no sex differences in either group ; ( 2 ) 15 affected parents ( 99 . 3 , SD 12 . 2 ) and their affected children ( 88 . 1 , SD 17 . 2 ) , where significance was dependent on parental sex being female ; and ( 3 ) 15 pairs of affected sibs ( 89 . 6 , SD 13 . 2 ) and their normal sibs ( 100 . 2 , SD 7 . 6 ) . IQ steadily declined as ( 1 ) the age of onset of signs and symptoms decreased , and ( 2 ) the CTG expansion size increased . The correlation appeared to be more linear with age of onset . The correlation of IQ difference and CTG expansion difference in both the DM parent-child pairs and normal sib-affected sib pairs was poor , indicating that CTG expansion is not a reliable predictor of IQ either in individual persons or families . Further analysis of cognitive function in DM is required to clarify specific deficits characteristic of this patient group";neurological
Phenotypic characterization of individuals with 30-40 CAG repeats in the Huntington disease (HD) gene reveals HD cases with 36 repeats and apparently normal elderly individuals with 36-39 repeats.;Abnormal CAG expansions in the IT-15 gene are associated with Huntington disease ( HD ) . In the diagnostic setting it is necessary to define the limits of the CAG size ranges on normal and HD-associated chromosomes . Most large analyses that defined the limits of the normal and pathological size ranges employed PCR assays , which included the CAG repeats and a CCG repeat tract that was thought to be invariant . Many of these experiments found an overlap between the normal and disease size ranges . Subsequent findings that the CCG repeats vary by 8 trinucleotide lengths suggested that the limits of the normal and disease size ranges should be reevaluated with assays that exclude the CCG polymorphism . Since patients with between 30 and 40 repeats are rare , a consortium was assembled to collect such individuals . All 178 samples were reanalyzed in Cambridge by using assays specific for the CAG repeats . We have optimized methods for reliable sizing of CAG repeats and show cases that demonstrate the dangers of using PCR assays that include both the CAG and CCG polymorphisms . Seven HD patients had 36 repeats , which confirms that this allele is associated with disease . Individuals without apparent symptoms or signs of HD were found at 36 repeats ( aged 74 , 78 , 79 , and 87 years ) , 37 repeats ( aged 69 years ) , 38 repeats ( aged 69 and 90 years ) , and 39 repeats ( aged 67 , 90 , and 95 years ) . The detailed case histories of an exceptional case from this series will be presented  a 95-year-old man with 39 repeats who did not have classical features of HD . The apparently healthy survival into old age of some individuals with 36-39 repeats suggests that the HD mutation may not always be fully penetrant . .;neurological

High-dose tranexamic Acid is associated with nonischemic clinical seizures in cardiac surgical patients.;BACKGROUND: In 2 separate centers, we observed a notable increase in the incidence of postoperative convulsive seizures from 1.3% to 3.8% in patients having undergone major cardiac surgical procedures. These events were temporally coincident with the initial use of high-dose tranexamic acid (TXA) therapy after withdrawal of aprotinin from general clinical usage. The purpose of this review was to perform a retrospective analysis to examine whether there was a relation between TXA usage and seizures after cardiac surgery. METHODS: An in-depth chart review was undertaken in all 24 patients who developed perioperative seizures. Electroencephalographic activity was recorded in 11 of these patients, and all patients had a formal neurological evaluation and brain imaging studies. RESULTS: Twenty-one of the 24 patients did not have evidence of new cerebral ischemic injury, but seizures were likely due to ischemic brain injury in 3 patients. All patients with seizures did not have permanent neurological abnormalities. All 24 patients with seizures received high doses of TXA intraoperatively ranging from 61 to 259 mg/kg, had a mean age of 69.9 years, and 21 of 24 had undergone open chamber rather than coronary bypass procedures. All but one patient were managed using cardiopulmonary bypass. No evidence of brain ischemic, metabolic, or hyperthermia-induced causes for their seizures was apparent. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that use of high-dose TXA in older patients in conjunction with cardiopulmonary bypass and open-chamber cardiac surgery is associated with clinical seizures in susceptible patients.;neurological|cardiovascular

Associations between use of benzodiazepines or related drugs and health, physical abilities and cognitive function: a non-randomised clinical study in the elderly.;OBJECTIVE: To describe associations between the use of benzodiazepines or related drugs (BZDs/RDs) and health, functional abilities and cognitive function in the elderly. METHODS: A non-randomised clinical study of patients aged > or =65 years admitted to acute hospital wards during 1 month. 164 patients (mean age +/- standard deviation [SD] 81.6 +/- 6.8 years) were admitted. Of these, nearly half (n = 78) had used BZDs/RDs before admission, and the remainder (n = 86) were non-users. Cognitive ability was assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Patients scoring > or =20 MMSE sum points were interviewed (n = 79) and questioned regarding symptoms and functional abilities during the week prior to admission. Data on use of BZDs/RDs before admission, current medications and discharge diagnoses were collected from medical records. Health, physical abilities and cognitive function were compared between BZD/RD users and non-users, and adjustments were made for confounding variables. The residual serum concentrations of oxazepam, temazepam and zopiclone were analysed. RESULTS: The mean +/- SD duration of BZD/RD use was 7 +/- 7 years (range 1-31). Two or three BZDs/RDs were concomitantly taken by 26% of users (n = 20). Long-term use of these drugs was associated with female sex and use of a higher number of drugs with effects on the CNS, which tended to be related to diagnosed dementia. After adjustment for these variables as confounders, use of BZDs/RDs was not associated with cognitive function as measured by the MMSE. However, use of BZDs/RDs was associated with dizziness, inability to sleep after awaking at night and tiredness in the mornings during the week prior to admission and with stronger depressive symptoms measured at the beginning of the hospital stay. Use of BZDs/RDs tended to be associated with a reduced ability to walk and shorter night-time sleep during the week prior to admission. A higher residual serum concentration of temazepam correlated with a lower MMSE sum score after adjustment for confounding variables. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term use and concomitant use of more than one BZD/RD were common in elderly patients hospitalised because of acute illnesses. Long-term use was associated with daytime and night-time symptoms indicative of poorer health and potentially caused by the adverse effects of these drugs.;neurological

Coexistence of cerebral venous sinus and internal carotid artery thrombosis associated with exogenous sex hormones. A case report.;A forty-six year-old premenopausal woman developed headache, nausea and vomiting, left hemiparesis and seizure two days after parenteral use of progesterone and estradiol. Diabetes mellitus (DM) was found during admission. Computed tomography showed a hemorrhagic infarct in the right frontal lobe and increased density in the superior sagittal sinus (SSS). Left carotid angiography found occlusion of the left internal carotid artery (ICA). Right carotid angiograms failed to show the SSS and inferior sagittal sinus, suggestive of venous sinus thrombosis. Coexistence of the cerebral artery and the venous sinus occlusion has been described infrequently. In this case, the authors postulate that the use of estradiol and progesterone and the underlying DM increased vascular thrombogenicity, which provided a common denominator for thrombosis of both the ICA and the venous sinus.;neurological|cardiovascular
cDNA microarrays detect activation of a myogenic transcription program by the PAX3-FKHR fusion oncogene.;"Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma is an aggressive pediatric cancer of striated muscle characterized in 60 % of cases by a t ( 2 ; 13 ) ( q35 ; q14 ) . This results in the fusion of PAX3 , a developmental transcription factor required for limb myogenesis , with FKHR , a member of the forkhead family of transcription factors . The resultant PAX3-FKHR gene possesses transforming properties ; however , the effects of this chimeric oncogene on gene expression are largely unknown . To investigate the actions of these transcription factors , both Pax3 and PAX3-FKHR were introduced into NIH 3T3 cells , and the resultant gene expression changes were analyzed with a murine cDNA microarray containing 2 , 225 elements . We found that PAX3-FKHR but not PAX3 activated a myogenic transcription program including the induction of transcription factors MyoD , Myogenin , Six1 , and Slug as well as a battery of genes involved in several aspects of muscle function . Notable among this group were the growth factor gene Igf2 and its binding protein Igfbp5 . Relevance of this model was suggested by verification that three of these genes ( IGFBP5 , HSIX1 , and Slug ) were also expressed in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines . This study utilizes cDNA microarrays to elucidate the pattern of gene expression induced by an oncogenic transcription factor and demonstrates the profound myogenic properties of PAX3-FKHR in NIH 3T3 cells . .";oncological

Salicylate nephropathy in the Gunn rat: potential role of prostaglandins.;"We examined the potential role of prostaglandins in the development of analgesic nephropathy in the Gunn strain of rat. The homozygous Gunn rats have unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia due to the absence of glucuronyl transferase, leading to marked bilirubin deposition in renal medulla and papilla. These rats are also highly susceptible to develop papillary necrosis with analgesic administration. We used homozygous (jj) and phenotypically normal heterozygous (jJ) animals. Four groups of rats (n = 7) were studied: jj and jJ rats treated either with aspirin 300 mg/kg every other day or sham-treated. After one week, slices of cortex, outer and inner medulla from one kidney were incubated in buffer and prostaglandin synthesis was determined by radioimmunoassay. The other kidney was examined histologically. A marked corticomedullary gradient of prostaglandin synthesis was observed in all groups. PGE2 synthesis was significantly higher in outer medulla, but not cortex or inner medulla, of jj (38 +/- 6 ng/mg prot) than jJ rats (15 +/- 3) (p less than 0.01). Aspirin treatment reduced PGE2 synthesis in all regions, but outer medullary PGE2 remained higher in jj (18 +/- 3) than jJ rats (9 +/- 2) (p less than 0.05). PGF2 alpha was also significantly higher in the outer medulla of jj rats with and without aspirin administration (p less than 0.05). The changes in renal prostaglandin synthesis were accompanied by evidence of renal damage in aspirin-treated jj but not jJ rats as evidenced by: increased incidence and severity of hematuria (p less than 0.01); increased serum creatinine (p less than 0.05); and increase in outer medullary histopathologic lesions (p less than 0.005 compared to either sham-treated jj or aspirin-treated jJ). These results suggest that enhanced prostaglandin synthesis contributes to maintenance of renal function and morphological integrity, and that inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis may lead to pathological renal medullary lesions and deterioration of renal function.";hepatorenal

Genetic linkage map of six polymorphic DNA markers around the gene for familial adenomatous polyposis on chromosome 5.;A genetic linkage map of six polymorphic DNA markers close to the gene ( APC ) for familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) on chromosome 5q is reported . One hundred fifty-five typed members of nine FAP kindred provided more than 90 meioses for linkage analysis . A number of crucial recombination events have been identified which are informative at three or more loci , allowing confident ordering of parts of the map . There was no evidence of genetic heterogeneity , with all families showing linkage of at least one chromosome 5 marker to the gene . Recombination data and two-point linkage analysis support a locus order of centromere-pi 227-C11P11-ECB27-L5 . 62-APC-EF5 62-APC-EF5 . 44-YN5 44-YN5 . 48-telomer e , although EF5 . 44 could lie in the interval L5 . 62-APC or ECB27-L5 . 62 . No recombinants were identified between APC and either EF5 . 44 or YN5 . 48 , but published deletion mapping in colorectal carcinomas and linkage analysis in FAP suggest that YN5 . 48 is 1-3 cM from APC . The present study suggests that YN5 . 48 and L5 . 62 delineate a small region of chromosome 5 within which the EF5 . 44 locus lies very close to the APC gene . These data not only allow use of flanking markers for presymptomatic diagnosis of FAP but also provide a high-density map of the region for isolation of the APC gene itself and for further assessment of the role of chromosome 5 deletions in the biology of sporadic colorectal cancer .;oncological
Prospective study of the long-term effects of somatostatin analog (octreotide) on gallbladder function and gallstone formation in Chinese acromegalic patients.;This article reports the changes in gallbladder function examined by ultrasonography in 20 Chinese patients with active acromegaly treated with sc injection of the somatostatin analog octreotide in dosages of 300-1500 micrograms/day for a mean of 24.2 +/- 13.9 months. During treatment with octreotide, 17 patients developed sludge, 10 had gallstones, and 1 developed acute cholecystitis requiring surgery. In all of 7 patients examined acutely, gallbladder contractility was inhibited after a single 100-micrograms injection. In 8 patients followed for 24 weeks, gallbladder contractility remained depressed throughout therapy. After withdrawal of octreotide in 10 patients without gallstones, 8 patients assessed had return of normal gallbladder contractility within 1 month. In 8 of the remaining 10 patients who developed gallstones during treatment, gallbladder contractility normalized in 5 patients (3 of whom has disappearance of their stones within 3 weeks), and remained depressed in 3 (2 of whom had stones present at 6 months). Our results suggest that the suppression of gallbladder contractility is the cause of the successive formation of bile sludge, gallstones, and cholecystitis during octreotide therapy in Chinese acromegalic patients. It is therefore very important to follow the changes of gallbladder function during long-term octreotide therapy of acromegalic patients.;neurological
Cardiotoxic and possible leukemogenic effects of adriamycin in nonhuman primates.;"10 monkeys (macaques) received adriamycin by monthly intravenous injections at 12 mg/m2 (1 mg/kg). 8 of the 10 monkeys developed congestive heart failure at an average cumulative adriamycin dose (310 mg/m2) well below that considered the safe upper limit (550 mg/m2) in man. Histologically, the myocardial lesions resembled those found in human anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy. 1 of the 10 monkeys developed acute myeloblastic leukemia after receiving 324 mg/m2 of adriamycin; the 10th monkey is alive and well 26 months after the last dose of drug. Our results suggest that adriamycin is a more potent cardiotoxin in monkeys than in man, and that leukemia may be a consequence of prolonged treatment with this drug.";cardiovascular|oncological

BRCA1 interacts with components of the histone deacetylase complex.;Germ-line mutations in the BRCA1 tumor-suppressor gene are associated with an increased susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer . BRCA1 contains a carboxyl-terminal domain ( BRCT ) that is shared with several other proteins involved in maintaining genome integrity . In an effort to understand the function of BRCA1 , we sought to isolate proteins that interact with the BRCT domain . Purified BRCT polypeptide was used as a probe to screen a human placenta cDNA expression library by Far Western analysis . Here we report that BRCA1 interacts in vivo and in vitro with the Rb-binding proteins , RbAp46 and RbAp48 , as well as with Rb . Moreover , the BRCT domain associates with the histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2 . These results demonstrate that BRCA1 interacts with components of the histone deacetylase complex , and therefore may explain the involvement of BRCA1 in multiple processes such as transcription , DNA repair , and recombination . .;oncological

Restriction of ocular fundus lesions to a specific subgroup of APC mutations in adenomatous polyposis coli patients.;In humans , alteration of the tumor suppressor gene , APC , causes adenomatous polyposis coli , a condition causing predisposition to colorectal cancer . The syndrome inconsistently associates characteristic patches of congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium ( CHRPE ) . Ocular examination revealed that patients expressing CHRPE tend to cluster within specific families . The exact APC mutation was identified in 42 unrelated patients . In all cases these mutations were predicted to lead to the synthesis of a truncated protein . The extent of CHRPE was found to be dependent on the position of the mutation along the coding sequence . CHRPE lesions are almost always absent if the mutation occurs before exon 9 , but are systematically present if it occurs after this exon . Thus , the range of phenotypic expression observed among affected patients may result in part from different allelic manifestations of APC mutations . .;oncological

Dynamic response of blood vessel in acute renal failure.;In this study we postulated that during acute renal failure induced by gentamicin the transient or dynamic response of blood vessels could be affected, and that antioxidants can prevent the changes in dynamic responses of blood vessels. The new approach to ex vivo blood vessel experiments in which not only the end points of vessels response within the time interval is considered, but also dynamics of this response, was used in this paper. Our results confirm the alteration in dynamic response of blood vessels during the change of pressure in gentamicin-treated animals. The beneficial effects of vitamin C administration to gentamicin-treated animals are also confirmed through: lower level of blood urea and creatinine and higher level of potassium. The pressure dynamic responses of isolated blood vessels show a faster pressure change in gentamicin-treated animals (8.07 +/- 1.7 s vs. 5.64 +/- 0.18 s). Vitamin C administration induced slowdown of pressure change back to the control values. The pressure dynamic properties, quantitatively defined by comparative pressure dynamic and total pressure dynamic, confirm the alteration in dynamic response of blood vessels during the change of pressure in gentamicin-treated animals and beneficial effects of vitamin C administration.;hepatorenal

Morphine-induced seizures in newborn infants.;Two neonates suffered from generalized seizures during the course of intravenous morphine sulfate for post-operative analgesia. They received morphine in doses of 32 micrograms/kg/hr and 40 micrograms/kg/hr larger than a group of 10 neonates who received 6-24 micrograms/kg/hr and had no seizures. Plasma concentrations of morphine in these neonates was excessive (60 and 90 mg/ml). Other known reasons for seizures were ruled out and the convulsions stopped a few hours after cessation of morphine and did not reoccur in the subsequent 8 months. It is suggested that post-operative intravenous morphine should not exceed 20 micrograms/kg/ml in neonates.;neurological

Glyceryl trinitrate induces attacks of migraine without aura in sufferers of migraine with aura.;Migraine with aura and migraine without aura have the same pain phase, thus indicating that migraine with aura and migraine without aura share a common pathway of nociception. In recent years, increasing evidence has suggested that the messenger molecule nitric oxide (NO) is involved in pain mechanisms of migraine without aura. In order to clarify whether the same is true for migraine with aura, in the present study we examined the headache response to intravenous infusion of glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) (0.5 microg/kg/min for 20 min) in 12 sufferers of migraine with aura. The specific aim was to elucidate whether an aura and/or an attack of migraine without aura could be induced. Fourteen healthy subjects served as controls. Aura symptoms were not elicited in any subject. Headache was more severe in migraineurs than in the controls during and immediately after GTN infusion (p=0.037) as well as during the following 11 h (p = 0.008). In the controls, the GTN-induced headache gradually disappeared, whereas in migraineurs peak headache intensity occurred at a mean time of 240 min post-infusion. At this time the induced headache in 6 of 12 migraineurs fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for migraine without aura of the International Headache Society. The results therefore suggest that NO is involved in the pain mechanisms of migraine with aura. Since cortical spreading depression has been shown to liberate NO in animals, this finding may help our understanding of the coupling between cortical spreading depression and headache in migraine with aura.;neurological
Nicotine-induced nystagmus correlates with midpontine activation.;"The pathomechanism of nicotine-induced nystagmus (NIN) is unknown. The aim of this study was to delineate brain structures that are involved in NIN generation. Eight healthy volunteers inhaled nicotine in darkness during a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment; eye movements were registered using video-oculography. NIN correlated with blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) activity levels in a midpontine site in the posterior basis pontis. NIN-induced midpontine activation may correspond to activation of the dorsomedial pontine nuclei and the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis, structures known to participate in the generation of multidirectional saccades and smooth pursuit eye movements.";neurological

Transient neurologic symptoms after spinal anesthesia: a lower incidence with prilocaine and bupivacaine than with lidocaine.;"BACKGROUND: Recent evidence suggests that transient neurologic symptoms (TNSs) frequently follow lidocaine spinal anesthesia but are infrequent with bupivacaine. However, identification of a short-acting local anesthetic to substitute for lidocaine for brief surgical procedures remains an important goal. Prilocaine is an amide local anesthetic with a duration of action similar to that of lidocaine. Accordingly, the present, prospective double-blind study compares prilocaine with lidocaine and bupivacaine with respect to duration of action and relative risk of TNSs. METHODS: Ninety patients classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I or II who were scheduled for short gynecologic procedures under spinal anesthesia were randomly allocated to receive 2.5 ml 2% lidocaine in 7.5% glucose, 2% prilocaine in 7.5% glucose, or 0.5% bupivacaine in 7.5% glucose. All solutions were provided in blinded vials by the hospital pharmacy. Details of spinal puncture, extension and regression of spinal block, and the times to reach discharge criteria were noted. In the evening of postoperative day 1, patients were evaluated for TNSs by a physician unaware of the drug administered and the details of the anesthetic procedure. RESULTS: Nine of 30 patients receiving lidocaine experienced TNSs, 1 of 30 patients receiving prilocaine (P = 0.03) had them, and none of 30 patients receiving bupivacaine had TNSs. Times to ambulate and to void were similar after lidocaine and prilocaine (150 vs. 165 min and 238 vs. 253 min, respectively) but prolonged after bupivacaine (200 and 299 min, respectively; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Prilocaine may be preferable to lidocaine for short surgical procedures because it has a similar duration of action but a lower incidence of TNSs.";neurological
Optimising stroke prevention in non-valvular atrial fibrillation.;Atrial fibrillation is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Pooled data from trials comparing antithrombotic treatment with placebo have shown that warfarin reduces the risk of stroke by 62%, and that aspirin alone reduces the risk by 22%. Overall, in high-risk patients, warfarin is superior to aspirin in preventing strokes, with a relative risk reduction of 36%. Ximelagatran, an oral direct thrombin inhibitor, was found to be as efficient as vitamin K antagonist drugs in the prevention of embolic events, but has been recently withdrawn because of abnormal liver function tests. The ACTIVE-W (Atrial Fibrillation Clopidogrel Trial with Irbesartan for Prevention of Vascular Events) study has demonstrated that warfarin is superior to platelet therapy (clopidogrel plus aspirin) in the prevention af embolic events. Idraparinux, a Factor Xa inhibitor, is being evaluated in patients with atrial fibrillation. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor-blocking drugs hold promise in atrial fibrillation through cardiac remodelling. Preliminary studies suggest that statins could interfere with the risk of recurrence after electrical cardioversion. Finally, percutaneous methods for the exclusion of left atrial appendage are under investigation in high-risk patients.;cardiovascular|hepatorenal

Prolongation of the QT interval related to cisapride-diltiazem interaction.;Cisapride, a cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) substrate, is widely prescribed for the treatment of gastrointestinal motility disorders. Prolongation of QT interval, torsades de pointes, and sudden cardiac death have been reported after concomitant administration with erythromycin or azole antifungal agents, but not with other CYP3A4 inhibitors. A possible drug interaction occurred in a 45-year-old woman who was taking cisapride for gastroesophageal reflux disorder and diltiazem, an agent that has inhibitory effect on CYP3A4, for hypertension. The patient was in near syncope and had QT-interval prolongation. After discontinuing cisapride, the QT interval returned to normal and symptoms did not recur. We suggest that caution be taken when cisapride is prescribed with any potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, including diltiazem.;neurological|cardiovascular
Tight linkage between myotonic dystrophy and apolipoprotein E genes revealed with allele-specific oligonucleotides.;In 16 families with myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) a novel approach based on use of allele-specific oligonucleotides has been employed to study the linkage relationship between the apolipoprotein E ( APOE ) gene and DM . Synthetic oligonucleotides , designed to discriminate between APOE alleles epsilon 3 and epsilon 4 , enabled us to distinguish heterozygous carriers in a hybridization assay . In a subset of families , the relevant segment of the APOE gene was enzymatically amplified to increase the sensitivity of the method . For DM and APOE , a maximum lod score ( zmax of 7 . 47 was obtained at a recombination frequency ( theta ) of 0 . 047 ( male theta = female theta ) . No recombination ( maximum lod score of 5 . 61 at theta = 0 . 0 ) was found between APOE and the apolipoprotein CII ( APOC2 ) gene . These results suggest that , in addition to APOC2 , APOE is a useful marker for presymptomatic DM diagnosis .;neurological

Corneal ulcers associated with aerosolized crack cocaine use.;PURPOSE: We report 4 cases of corneal ulcers associated with drug abuse. The pathogenesis of these ulcers and management of these patients are also reviewed. METHODS: Review of all cases of corneal ulcers associated with drug abuse seen at our institution from July 2006 to December 2006. RESULTS: Four patients with corneal ulcers associated with crack cocaine use were reviewed. All corneal ulcers were cultured, and the patients were admitted to the hospital for intensive topical antibiotic treatment. Each patient received comprehensive health care, including medical and substance abuse consultations. Streptococcal organisms were found in 3 cases and Capnocytophaga and Brevibacterium casei in 1 patient. The infections responded to antibiotic treatment. Two patients needed a lateral tarsorrhaphy for persistent epithelial defects. CONCLUSIONS: Aerosolized crack cocaine use can be associated with the development of corneal ulcers. Drug abuse provides additional challenges for management. Not only treatment of their infections but also the overall poor health of the patients and increased risk of noncompliance need to be addressed. Comprehensive care may provide the patient the opportunity to discontinue their substance abuse, improve their overall health, and prevent future corneal complications.;neurological
Molecular analysis in familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus: early diagnosis of an asymptomatic carrier.;Familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus ( FNDI ) is an inherited deficiency of the hormone arginine vasopressin ( AVP ) and is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait . In the present study we have analyzed the AVP-neurophysin II ( AVP-NPII ) gene in a Spanish kindred . Studies were performed on seven members ( four clinically affected ) of the family . Patients were diagnosed at the Hospital Universitario Gregorio Maranon ( Madrid , Spain ) . The entire coding region of the AVP-NPII gene of all family members was amplified by PCR and sequenced . All affected individuals presented a missense mutation ( G1757-- > A ) that replaces glycine at position 23 with arginine within the NPII domain . The substitution was confirmed by restriction endonuclease analysis and was present in heterozygosis . Additionally , one of the asymptomatic relatives ( a girl 8 months old at the time of study ) was identified as carrier of the same mutation and developed the disease 3 months later . The alteration found in the second exon of the gene in this family seems to be responsible for the disease , as all individuals harboring the mutation had been previously diagnosed or have eventually developed FNDI . Identification of the molecular defect underlying FNDI in affected families is a powerful tool for early asymptomatic diagnosis in infants . .;neurological

Significant differences were found between PWS patients , SIB controls , and WC controls in the prevalence of febrile convulsions , fever-associated symptoms , and temperature less than 94 degrees F . No differences were noted in any variable between the PWS patients and the ND controls , suggesting that these abnormalities are not unique to PWS , but can occur in any neurodevelopmentally handicapped individual , further suggesting these do not necessarily reflect syndrome-specific hypothalamic abnormalities . .;neurological
Acute confusion induced by a high-dose infusion of 5-fluorouracil and folinic acid.;A 61-year-old man was treated with combination chemotherapy incorporating cisplatinum, etoposide, high-dose 5-fluorouracil (2,250 mg/m2/24 hours) and folinic acid for an inoperable gastric adenocarcinoma. He developed acute neurologic symptoms of mental confusion, disorientation and irritability, and then lapsed into a deep coma, lasting for approximately 40 hours during the first dose (day 2) of 5-fluorouracil and folinic acid infusion. This complication reappeared on day 25 during the second dose of 5-fluorouracil and folinic acid, which were then the only drugs given. Because folinic acid was unlikely to be associated with this condition, neurotoxicity due to high-dose 5-fluorouracil was highly suspected. The pathogenesis of 5-fluorouracil neurotoxicity may be due to a Krebs cycle blockade by fluoroacetate and fluorocitrate, thiamine deficiency, or dihydrouracil dehydrogenase deficiency. High-dose 5-fluorouracil/folinic acid infusion therapy has recently become a popular regimen for various cancers. It is necessary that both oncologists and neurologists be fully aware of this unusual complication.;neurological|oncological
Pubertal exposure to Bisphenol A increases anxiety-like behavior and decreases acetylcholinesterase activity of hippocampus in adult male mice.;The negative effects of Bisphenol A (BPA) on neurodevelopment and behaviors have been well established. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is a regulatory enzyme which is involved in anxiety-like behavior. This study investigated behavioral phenotypes and AChE activity in male mice following BPA exposure during puberty. On postnatal day (PND) 35, male mice were exposed to 50mg BPA/kg diet per day for a period of 35 days. On PND71, a behavioral assay was performed using the elevated plus maze (EPM) and the light/dark test. In addition, AChE activity was measured in the prefrontal cortex, hypothalamus, cerebellum and hippocampus. Results from our behavioral phenotyping indicated that anxiety-like behavior was increased in mice exposed to BPA. AChE activity was significantly decreased in the hippocampus of mice with BPA compared to control mice, whereas no difference was found in the prefrontal cortex, hypothalamus and cerebellum. Our findings showed that pubertal BPA exposure increased anxiety-like behavior, which may be associated with decreased AChE activity of the hippocampus in adult male mice. Further studies are necessary to investigate the cholinergic signaling of the hippocampus in PBE induced anxiety-like behaviors.;neurological
Hepatocellular carcinoma in Fanconi's anemia treated with androgen and corticosteroid.;The case of an 11-year-old boy is reported who was known to have Fanconi's anemia for 3 years and was treated with androgens, corticosteroids and transfusions.

Spironolactone-induced renal insufficiency and hyperkalemia in patients with heart failure.;BACKGROUND: A previous randomized controlled trial evaluating the use of spironolactone in heart failure patients reported a low risk of hyperkalemia (2%) and renal insufficiency (0%). Because treatments for heart failure have changed since the benefits of spironolactone were reported, the prevalence of these complications may differ in current clinical practice. We therefore sought to determine the prevalence and clinical associations of hyperkalemia and renal insufficiency in heart failure patients treated with spironolactone. METHODS: We performed a case control study of heart failure patients treated with spironolactone in our clinical practice. Cases were patients who developed hyperkalemia (K(+) >5.0 mEq/L) or renal insufficiency (Cr >or=2.5 mg/dL), and they were compared to 2 randomly selected controls per case. Clinical characteristics, medications, and serum chemistries at baseline and follow-up time periods were compared. RESULTS: Sixty-seven of 926 patients (7.2%) required discontinuation of spironolactone due to hyperkalemia (n = 33) or renal failure (n = 34). Patients who developed hyperkalemia were older and more likely to have diabetes, had higher baseline serum potassium levels and lower baseline potassium supplement doses, and were more likely to be treated with beta-blockers than controls (n = 134). Patients who developed renal insufficiency had lower baseline body weight and higher baseline serum creatinine, required higher doses of loop diuretics, and were more likely to be treated with thiazide diuretics than controls. CONCLUSIONS: Spironolactone-induced hyperkalemia and renal insufficiency are more common in our clinical experience than reported previously. This difference is explained by patient comorbidities and more frequent use of beta-blockers.;cardiovascular|hepatorenal

Methamphetamine causes alterations in the MAP kinase-related pathways in the brains of mice that display increased aggressiveness.;Aggressive behaviors have been reported in patients who suffer from some psychiatric disorders, and are common in methamphetamine (METH) abusers. Herein, we report that multiple (but not single) injections of METH significantly increased aggressiveness in male CD-1 mice. This increase in aggressiveness was not secondary to METH-induced hyperactivity. Analysis of protein expression using antibody microarrays and Western blotting revealed differential changes in MAP kinase-related pathways after multiple and single METH injections. There were statistically significant (p<0.05) decreases in MEK1, Erk2p, GSK3alpha, 14-3-3e, and MEK7 in the striata of mice after multiple injections of METH. MEK1 was significantly decreased also after a single injection of METH, but to a much lesser degree than after multiple injections of METH. In the frontal cortex, there was a statistically significant decrease in GSK3alpha after multiple (but not single) injections of METH. These findings suggest that alterations in MAP kinase-related pathways in the prefronto-striatal circuitries might be involved in the manifestation of aggressive behaviors in mice.;neurological
Cerebellar sensory processing alterations impact motor cortical plasticity in Parkinson's disease: clues from dyskinetic patients.;The plasticity of primary motor cortex (M1) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and levodopa-induced dyskinesias (LIDs) is severely impaired. We recently reported in young healthy subjects that inhibitory cerebellar stimulation enhanced the sensorimotor plasticity of M1 that was induced by paired associative stimulation (PAS). This study demonstrates that the deficient sensorimotor M1 plasticity in 16 patients with LIDs could be reinstated by a single session of real inhibitory cerebellar stimulation but not sham stimulation. This was evident only when a sensory component was involved in the induction of plasticity, indicating that cerebellar sensory processing function is involved in the resurgence of M1 plasticity. The benefit of inhibitory cerebellar stimulation on LIDs is known. To explore whether this benefit is linked to the restoration of sensorimotor plasticity of M1, we conducted an additional study looking at changes in LIDs and PAS-induced plasticity after 10 sessions of either bilateral, real inhibitory cerebellar stimulation or sham stimulation. Only real and not sham stimulation had an antidyskinetic effect and it was paralleled by a resurgence in the sensorimotor plasticity of M1. These results suggest that alterations in cerebellar sensory processing function, occurring secondary to abnormal basal ganglia signals reaching it, may be an important element contributing to the maladaptive sensorimotor plasticity of M1 and the emergence of abnormal involuntary movements.;neurological

Analysis of deletions in DNA from patients with Becker and Duchenne muscular dystrophy.;Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD ) is an X-linked recessive genetic disorder for which the biochemical defect is as yet unknown . Recently , two cloned segments of human X-chromosome DNA have been described which detect structural alterations within or near the genetic locus responsible for the disorder . Both of these cloned segments were described as tightly linked to the locus and were capable of detecting deletions in the DNA of boys affected with DMD . In an attempt to determine more precisely the occurrence of these deletions within a large population of DMD patients and the accuracy of one of the segments , DXS164 ( pERT87 ) , in determining the inheritance of the DMD X chromosome , the subclones 1 , 8 and 15 were made available to many investigators throughout the world . Here we describe the combined results of more than 20 research laboratories with respect to the occurrence of deletions at the DXS164 locus in DNA samples isolated from patients with DMD and Becker muscular dystrophy ( BMD ) . The results indicate that the DXS164 locus apparently recombines with DMD 5 % of the time , but is probably located between independent sites of mutation which yield DMD . The breakpoints of some deletions are delineated within the DXS164 locus , and it is evident that the deletions at the DMD locus are frequent and extremely large . .;neurological

An arylsulfatase A (ARSA) missense mutation (T274M) causing late-infantile metachromatic leukodystrophy.;"Metachromatic leukodystrophy ( MLD ) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency of arylsulfatase A ( ARSA ; EC 3 . 1 1 . 6 6 . 8 ) . The 8 ARSA exons and adjacent intron boundaries from a patient with late-infantile metachromatic leukodystrophy were polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) amplified in seven discrete reactions . Amplified ARSA exons were analysed for the presence of sequence alterations by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis , followed by direct sequencing of PCR products . The patient was found to be homozygous for a C-- > T transition in exon IV that results in the substitution of a highly conserved threonine residue at amino acid 274 with a methionine ( T274M ) . Analysis of a further 29 MLD patients revealed the presence of five additional homozygotes for T274M . All 6 T274M homozygotes ( representing four families ) were of Lebanese descent , and all were known to be the result of consanguineous marriages . The altered amino acid is rigidly conserved among 10 sulfatases from Escherichia coli to humans ; therefore , it is most likely that the resultant mutant protein will have little or no enzyme activity . This is consistent with the very low ARSA activity measured in these patients and their uniformly severe clinical presentation";neurological
Aconitine-induced Ca2+ overload causes arrhythmia and triggers apoptosis through p38 MAPK signaling pathway in rats.;Aconitine is a major bioactive diterpenoid alkaloid with high content derived from herbal aconitum plants. Emerging evidence indicates that voltage-dependent Na(+) channels have pivotal roles in the cardiotoxicity of aconitine. However, no reports are available on the role of Ca(2+) in aconitine poisoning. In this study, we explored the importance of pathological Ca(2+) signaling in aconitine poisoning in vitro and in vivo. We found that Ca(2+) overload lead to accelerated beating rhythm in adult rat ventricular myocytes and caused arrhythmia in conscious freely moving rats. To investigate effects of aconitine on myocardial injury, we performed cytotoxicity assay in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs), as well as measured lactate dehydrogenase level in the culture medium of NRVMs and activities of serum cardiac enzymes in rats. The results showed that aconitine resulted in myocardial injury and reduced NRVMs viability dose-dependently. To confirm the pro-apoptotic effects, we performed flow cytometric detection, cardiac histology, transmission electron microscopy and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling assay. The results showed that aconitine stimulated apoptosis time-dependently. The expression analysis of Ca(2+) handling proteins demonstrated that aconitine promoted Ca(2+) overload through the expression regulation of Ca(2+) handling proteins. The expression analysis of apoptosis-related proteins revealed that pro-apoptotic protein expression was upregulated, and anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2 expression was downregulated. Furthermore, increased phosphorylation of MAPK family members, especially the P-P38/P38 ratio was found in cardiac tissues. Hence, our results suggest that aconitine significantly aggravates Ca(2+) overload and causes arrhythmia and finally promotes apoptotic development via phosphorylation of P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase.;neurological|cardiovascular

Incidence of neoplasms in patients with rheumatoid arthritis exposed to different treatment regimens.;Immunosuppressive drugs have been used during the last 30 years in treatment of patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis. The drugs commonly used are cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil (alkylating agents), azathioprine (purine analogue), and methotrexate (folic acid analogue). There is evidence that all four immunosuppressive drugs can reduce synovitis, but disease activity almost always recurs after therapy is stopped. Since adverse reactions are frequent, less than 50 percent of patients are able to continue a particular drug for more than one year. Since it takes three to 12 months to achieve maximal effects, those patients who are unable to continue the drug receive little benefit from it. Patients treated with alkylating agents have an increased risk of development of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia, and both alkylating agents and azathioprine are associated with the development of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Cyclophosphamide therapy increases the risk of carcinoma of the bladder. There have been several long-term studies of patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with azathioprine and cyclophosphamide and the incidence of most of the common cancers is not increased. Data on the possible increased risk of malignancy in rheumatoid arthritis are still being collected, and until further information is available, the use of immunosuppressive drugs, particularly alkylating agents, in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis should be reserved for patients with severe progressive disease or life-threatening complications.;neurological|oncological

Homozygous presence of the crossover (fusion gene) mutation identified in a type II Gaucher disease fetus: is this analogous to the Gaucher knock-out mouse model?;Gaucher disease ( GD ) is an inherited deficiency of beta-glucocerebrosidase ( EC 3 . 1 . 2 . 45 , gene symbol GBA ) . In type I GD , the CNS is not involved ( nonneuronopathic ) , whereas in type II GD ( acute neuronopathic ) CNS involvement is early and rapidly progressive , while in type III GD ( subacute neuronopathic ) CNS involvement occurs later and is slowly progressive . The T6433C ( L444P ) substitution is prevalent in type GD II . It may occur alone as a single base-pair mutation but often is found as part of a complex allele containing additional GBA nucleotide substitutions , G6468C ( A456P ) and G6482C ( V460V ) , without ( recNciI ) or with ( recTL ) G5957C ( D409H ) . This complex allele is presumed to have formed by recombination ( crossover , fusion ) of the structural gene with the pseudogene , which contains the mutated sequences .

Receptor mechanisms of nicotine-induced locomotor hyperactivity in chronic nicotine-treated rats.;Rats were pretreated with saline or nicotine (1.5 mg/kg per day) by subcutaneously implanting each animal with an Alzet osmotic mini-pump which continuously released saline or nicotine for 1, 5 and 14 days. At the end of each pretreatment period, animals were used for (i) determining their locomotor response to acutely injected nicotine (0.2 mg/kg, s.c.) and (ii) measuring the density of L-[3H]nicotine and [3H]spiperone binding sites in the striatum. We observed no changes in nicotine-induced locomotor response, striatal L-[3H]nicotine and [3H]spiperone binding in the animals pretreated with nicotine for 1 day. In rats which were pretreated with nicotine for 5 days, there was a significant increase in the nicotine-stimulated locomotor response which was associated with an increase in the number of L-[3H]nicotine binding sites and also with an elevated dopamine (DA) level in the striatum. The number of striatal [3H]spiperone binding sites was not affected. In animals pretreated with nicotine for 14 days, the nicotine-induced locomotor response remained to be potentiated. However, this response was correlated with an elevated number of striatal [3H]spiperone binding sites, whereas the number of striatal L-[3H]nicotine binding sites and the striatal DA level were normal. These results suggest that chronic nicotine-treated rats develop locomotor hyperactivity in response to nicotine initially due to increases of both the density of nicotinic receptors and DA concentration, followed by inducing DA receptor supersensitivity in the striatum.;neurological

Complement deficiency and nephritis.;"A report of a family. A family is described in which three children had homozygous deficiency of C3 and in which both parents and two other children were heterozygous for the C3 null gene . One child with heterozygous C3 deficiency was found to have membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis ; proteinuria and / or microscopical haematuria was present in all three homozygous C3-deficient children . All children with homozygous or heterozygous C3 deficiency were , to a varying degree , susceptible to infection . The only child of the family with normal complement had no increased risk of infection and no renal disease . This family study provides further support for the proposal that C3 deficiency predisposes to nephritis . .";hepatorenal
Increased coronary heart disease in Japanese-American men with mutation in the cholesteryl ester transfer protein gene despite increased HDL levels.;"Plasma high density lipoprotein ( HDL ) levels are strongly genetically determined and show a general inverse relationship with coronary heart disease ( CHD ) . The cholesteryl ester transfer protein ( CETP ) mediates the transfer of cholesteryl esters from HDL to other lipoproteins and is a key participant in the reverse transport of cholesterol from the periphery to the liver . A high prevalence of two different CETP gene mutations ( D442G , 5 . 1 % ; intron 14G  A , 0 . 5 % ) , was found in 3 , 469 men of Japanese ancestry in the Honolulu Heart Program and mutations were associated with decreased CETP ( -35 % ) and increased HDL chol levels ( + 10 % for D442G ) . However , the overall prevalence of definite CHD was 21 % in men with mutations and 16 % in men without mutations . The relative risk ( RR ) of CHD was 1 . 43 in men with mutations ( P CHD risk factors , the RR was 1 . 55 ( P = . 02 ) ; after additional adjustment for HDL levels , the RR was 1 . 68 ( P = . 008 ) . Similar RR values were obtained for the D442G mutation alone . Increased CHD in men with mutations was primarily observed for HDL chol 41-60 mg / dl ; for HDL chol > 60 mg / dl men with and without mutations had low CHD prevalence . Thus , genetic CETP deficiency appears to be an independent risk factor for CHD , primarily due to increased CHD prevalence in men with the D442G mutation and HDL cholesterol between 41 and 60 mg / dl . The findings suggest that both HDL concentration and the dynamics of cholesterol transport through HDL ( i . e. , reverse cholesterol transport ) determine the anti-atherogenicity of the HDL fraction .";cardiovascular|hepatorenal
Cause of death among patients with Parkinson's disease: a rare mortality due to cerebral haemorrhage.;Causes of death, with special reference to cerebral haemorrhage, among 240 patients with pathologically verified Parkinson's disease were investigated using the Annuals of the Pathological Autopsy Cases in Japan from 1981 to 1985. The leading causes of death were pneumonia and bronchitis (44.1%), malignant neoplasms (11.6%), heart diseases (4.1%), cerebral infarction (3.7%) and septicaemia (3.3%). Cerebral haemorrhage was the 11th most frequent cause of death, accounting for only 0.8% of deaths among the patients, whereas it was the 5th most common cause of death among the Japanese general population in 1985. The low incidence of cerebral haemorrhage as a cause of death in patients with Parkinson's disease may reflect the hypotensive effect of levodopa and a hypotensive mechanism due to reduced noradrenaline levels in the parkinsonian brain.;neurological|cardiovascular|hepatorenal|oncological

D-penicillamine in the treatment of localized scleroderma.;"Localized scleroderma has no recognized internal organ involvement but may be disfiguring and disabling when the cutaneous lesions are extensive or affect children. There is no accepted or proven treatment for localized scleroderma. Case reports of 11 patients with severe, extensive localized scleroderma who were treated with D-penicillamine are summarized in this article. This drug was judged to have a favorable effect on the disease course in 7 (64%) of 11 patients. Improvement began within 3 to 6 months and consisted of cessation of active cutaneous lesions in all 7 patients, skin softening in 5, and more normal growth of the affected limb in 2 of 3 children. Joint stiffness and contractures also improved. The dose of D-penicillamine associated with a favorable response was as low as 2 to 5 mg/kg per day given over a period ranging from 15 to 53 months. D-Penicillamine caused nephrotic syndrome in 1 patient and milder reversible proteinuria in 3 other patients; none developed renal insufficiency. These data suggest that D-penicillamine may be effective in severe cases of localized scleroderma.";hepatorenal

A Phase II trial of cisplatin plus WR-2721 (amifostine) for metastatic breast carcinoma: an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Study (E8188).;BACKGROUND: Cisplatin has minimal antitumor activity when used as second- or third-line treatment of metastatic breast carcinoma. Older reports suggest an objective response rate of 8% when 60-120 mg/m2 of cisplatin is administered every 3-4 weeks. Although a dose-response effect has been observed with cisplatin, the dose-limiting toxicities associated with cisplatin (e.g., nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity, and neurotoxicity) have limited its use as a treatment for breast carcinoma. WR-2721 or amifostine initially was developed to protect military personnel in the event of nuclear war. Amifostine subsequently was shown to protect normal tissues from the toxic effects of alkylating agents and cisplatin without decreasing the antitumor effect of the chemotherapy. Early trials of cisplatin and amifostine also suggested that the incidence and severity of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity, and neuropathy were reduced. METHODS: A Phase II study of the combination of cisplatin plus amifostine was conducted in patients with progressive metastatic breast carcinoma who had received one, but not more than one, chemotherapy regimen for metastatic disease. Patients received amifostine, 910 mg/m2 intravenously over 15 minutes. After completion of the amifostine infusion, cisplatin 120 mg/m2 was administered over 30 minutes. Intravenous hydration and mannitol was administered before and after cisplatin. Treatment was administered every 3 weeks until disease progression. RESULTS: Forty-four patients were enrolled in the study of which 7 (16%) were ineligible. A median of 2 cycles of therapy was administered to the 37 eligible patients. Six partial responses were observed for an overall response rate of 16%. Most patients (57%) stopped treatment because of disease progression. Neurologic toxicity was reported in 52% of patients. Seven different life-threatening toxicities were observed in patients while receiving treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of cisplatin and amifostine in this study resulted in an overall response rate of 16%. Neither a tumor-protective effect nor reduced toxicity to normal tissues was observed with the addition of amifostine to cisplatin in this trial.;neurological|hepatorenal|oncological
Disruption of splicing regulated by a CUG-binding protein in myotonic dystrophy.;Myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) is caused by a CTG expansion in the 3 untranslated region of the DM gene . One model of DM pathogenesis suggests that RNAs from the expanded allele create a gain-of-function mutation by the inappropriate binding of proteins to the CUG repeats . Data presented here indicate that the conserved heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein , CUG-binding protein ( CUG-BP ) , may mediate the trans-dominant effect of the RNA . CUG-BP was found to bind to the human cardiac troponin T ( cTNT ) pre-messenger RNA and regulate its alternative splicing . Splicing of cTNT was disrupted in DM striated muscle and in normal cells expressing transcripts that contain CUG repeats . Altered expression of genes regulated posttranscriptionally by CUG-BP therefore may contribute to DM pathogenesis . .;neurological

Effect of intravenous metoprolol or intravenous metoprolol plus glucagon on dobutamine-induced myocardial ischemia.;STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of metoprolol on dobutamine stress testing with technetium-99m sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomography imaging and ST-segment monitoring, and to assess the impact of intravenous glucagon on metoprolol's effects. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: Community hospital. PATIENTS: Twenty-two patients with known reversible perfusion defects. INTERVENTION: Patients underwent dobutamine stress tests per standard protocol. Before dobutamine was begun, no therapy was given during the first visit, and patients were randomized on subsequent visits to receive metoprolol or metoprolol plus glucagon 1 mg. Metoprolol was dosed to achieve a resting predobutamine heart rate below 65 beats/minute or a total intravenous dose of 20 mg. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Metoprolol reduced maximum heart rate 31%, summed stress scores 29%, and summed difference scores 43% versus control. Metoprolol plus glucagon also reduced the maximum heart rate 29% versus control. Summed stress and summed difference scores were not significantly reduced, although they were 18% and 30% lower, respectively, than control. No significant differences were found in any parameter between metoprolol and metoprolol-glucagon. CONCLUSION: During dobutamine stress testing, metoprolol attenuates or eliminates evidence of myocardial ischemia. Glucagon 1 mg, although somewhat effective, does not correct this effect to the extent that it can be administered clinically.;cardiovascular
The haemodynamic effects of propofol in combination with ephedrine in elderly patients (ASA groups 3 and 4).;The marked vasodilator and negative inotropic effects of propofol are disadvantages in frail elderly patients. We investigated the safety and efficacy of adding different doses of ephedrine to propofol in order to obtund the hypotensive response. The haemodynamic effects of adding 15, 20 or 25 mg of ephedrine to 200 mg of propofol were compared to control in 40 ASA 3/4 patients over 60 years presenting for genito-urinary surgery. The addition of ephedrine to propofol appears to be an effective method of obtunding the hypotensive response to propofol at all doses used in this study. However, marked tachycardia associated with the use of ephedrine in combination with propofol occurred in the majority of patients, occasionally reaching high levels in individual patients. Due to the risk of this tachycardia inducing myocardial ischemia, we would not recommend the use in elderly patients of any of the ephedrine/propofol/mixtures studied.;cardiovascular

Utility of troponin I in patients with cocaine-associated chest pain.;Baseline electrocardiogram abnormalities and market elevations not associated with myocardial necrosis make accurate diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI) difficult in patients with cocaine-associated chest pain. Troponin sampling may offer greater diagnostic utility in these patients. OBJECTIVE: To assess outcomes based on troponin positivity in patients with cocaine chest pain admitted for exclusion of MI. METHODS: Outcomes were examined in patients admitted for possible MI after cocaine use. All patients underwent a rapid rule-in protocol that included serial sampling of creatine kinase (CK), CK-MB, and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) over eight hours. Outcomes included CK-MB MI (CK-MB >or= 8 ng/mL with a relative index [(CK-MB x 100)/total CK] >or= 4, cardiac death, and significant coronary disease (>or=50%). RESULTS: Of the 246 admitted patients, 34 (14%) met CK-MB criteria for MI and 38 (16%) had cTnI elevations. Angiography was performed in 29 of 38 patients who were cTnI-positive, with significant disease present in 25 (86%). Three of the four patients without significant disease who had cTnI elevations met CK-MB criteria for MI, and the other had a peak CK-MB level of 13 ng/mL. Sensitivities, specificities, and positive and negative likelihood ratios for predicting cardiac death or significant disease were high for both CK-MB MI and cTnI and were not significantly different. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with cTnI elevations meet CK-MB criteria for MI, as well as have a high incidence of underlying significant disease. Troponin appears to have an equivalent diagnostic accuracy compared with CK-MB for diagnosing necrosis in patients with cocaine-associated chest pain and suspected MI.;cardiovascular

Effects of long-term pretreatment with isoproterenol on bromocriptine-induced tachycardia in conscious rats.;It has been shown that bromocriptine-induced tachycardia, which persisted after adrenalectomy, is (i) mediated by central dopamine D2 receptor activation and (ii) reduced by 5-day isoproterenol pretreatment, supporting therefore the hypothesis that this effect is dependent on sympathetic outflow to the heart. This study was conducted to examine whether prolonged pretreatment with isoproterenol could abolish bromocriptine-induced tachycardia in conscious rats. Isoproterenol pretreatment for 15 days caused cardiac hypertrophy without affecting baseline blood pressure and heart rate. In control rats, intravenous bromocriptine (150 microg/kg) induced significant hypotension and tachycardia. Bromocriptine-induced hypotension was unaffected by isoproterenol pretreatment, while tachycardia was reversed to significant bradycardia, an effect that was partly reduced by i.v. domperidone (0.5 mg/kg). Neither cardiac vagal nor sympathetic tone was altered by isoproterenol pretreatment. In isolated perfused heart preparations from isoproterenol-pretreated rats, the isoproterenol-induced maximal increase in left ventricular systolic pressure was significantly reduced, compared with saline-pretreated rats (the EC50 of the isoproterenol-induced increase in left ventricular systolic pressure was enhanced approximately 22-fold). These results show that 15-day isoproterenol pretreatment not only abolished but reversed bromocriptine-induced tachycardia to bradycardia, an effect that is mainly related to further cardiac beta-adrenoceptor desensitization rather than to impairment of autonomic regulation of the heart. They suggest that, in normal conscious rats, the central tachycardia of bromocriptine appears to predominate and to mask the bradycardia of this agonist at peripheral dopamine D2 receptors.;cardiovascular|hepatorenal

Epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) subunit mRNA and protein expression in rats with puromycin aminonucleoside-induced nephrotic syndrome.;In experimental nephrotic syndrome, urinary sodium excretion is decreased during the early phase of the disease. The molecular mechanism(s) leading to salt retention has not been completely elucidated. The rate-limiting constituent of collecting duct sodium transport is the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). We examined the abundance of ENaC subunit mRNAs and proteins in puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN)-induced nephrotic syndrome. The time courses of urinary sodium excretion, plasma aldosterone concentration and proteinuria were studied in male Sprague-Dawley rats treated with a single dose of either PAN or vehicle. The relative amounts of alphaENaC, betaENaC and gammaENaC mRNAs were determined in kidneys from these rats by real-time quantitative TaqMan PCR, and the amounts of proteins by Western blot. The kinetics of urinary sodium excretion and the appearance of proteinuria were comparable with those reported previously. Sodium retention occurred on days 2, 3 and 6 after PAN injection. A significant up-regulation of alphaENaC and betaENaC mRNA abundance on days 1 and 2 preceded sodium retention on days 2 and 3. Conversely, down-regulation of alphaENaC, betaENaC and gammaENaC mRNA expression on day 3 occurred in the presence of high aldosterone concentrations, and was followed by a return of sodium excretion to control values. The amounts of alphaENaC, betaENaC and gammaENaC proteins were not increased during PAN-induced sodium retention. In conclusion, ENaC mRNA expression, especially alphaENaC, is increased in the very early phase of the experimental model of PAN-induced nephrotic syndrome in rats, but appears to escape from the regulation by aldosterone after day 3.;hepatorenal

The EWS gene, involved in Ewing family of tumors, malignant melanoma of soft parts and desmoplastic small round cell tumors, codes for an RNA binding protein with novel regulatory domains.;The EWS gene , which maps to band q12 of human chromosome 22 , is involved in a wide variety of human solid tumors including Ewing sarcoma , related primitive neuroectodermal tumors , malignant melanoma of soft parts and desmoplastic small round cell tumors . In these tumors , the EWS is fused to genes encoding transcriptional activators / repressors , like Fli-1 or erg or ATF 1 or wt1 . To better understand the function of the EWS protein , we cloned the EWS cDNA . Sequence analysis of this cDNA revealed differential splicing involving two exons encoding 72 amino acids . Both alternatively spliced transcripts , EWS and EWS-b , are expressed in a variety of cells . Because EWS proteins contain putative conserved RNA binding motifs , we studied the RNA binding properties of the EWS protein . The EWS-b protein binds to RNA in vitro and , specifically , to poly G and poly U . The RNA binding activity was localized to the carboxy terminal 86 amino acids , which constitute RGG box . Thus the amino terminal domain of EWS ( NTD-EWS ) , which is involved in chromosome translocation may regulate the specificity of RNA binding activity of EWS . An EWS-erg chimeric protein , which is found in Ewings sarcoma cells , functions as a transcriptional activator . Mutational analysis of EWS-erg chimeric protein revealed that NTD-EWS functions as a regulatory domain for the transcriptional activation properties of EWS-erg chimeric protein . .;neurological|oncological
